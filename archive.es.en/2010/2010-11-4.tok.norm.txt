shortly after starting his visit to paris , hu signed deals worth $ 20 billion . french president nicolas sarkozy and his chinese counterpart hu jintao solidified their countries ' economic ties thursday during the beginning of hu 's three-day visit to france . hu signed on thursday a series of deals with french airplane and energy firms worth at least $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- . " china should not be seen as a threat but as an opportunity , " sarkozy said prior to hu 's arrival .
sarkozy seeks to strengthen his country 's relations with china prior to france taking over the group of 20 presidency on november 12 , following the g20 summit in south korea . the summit is expected to be a major topic of discussion between the two leaders , as the key issue in south korea will be the exchange rate of the chinese currency .
the us and other industrial nations accuse china of keeping the yuan 's rate artificially low in order to give chinese exports an advantage on the world market . billions in new contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two presidents toasted each other at a state dinner hu 's visit immediately became lucrative for france : sarkozy 's office announced that chinese airlines had agreed to purchase 102 jets from airbus , in a deal worth $ 14 billion alone .
an agreement was also signed between france 's energy producer areva and china guangdong nuclear power corp. franco-american telecom giant alcatel-lucent announced deals with three chinese operators - china mobile , china telecom and china unicom - worth 1.17 billion euros . local authorities also meanwhile announced a new 500-million-euro franco-chinese business district in the central-french town of chateauroux , which is expected to create 4,000 jobs in 2012 . rolling out the red carpet hu received a warm welcome from sarkozy and french first lady carla bruni thursday afternoon at paris ' orly airport .
after reviewing french troops , the two leaders paraded down the champs-elysees , where french and chinese flags hung overhead and spectators were held behind barricades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was criticized for not speaking out for imprisoned nobel prize winner liu xiaobo they conducted their first round of talks at the elysee palace before a full state dinner , where the two were set to toast each other in their only scheduled , official public statements during the visit . the two presidents ' choice not to make public statements during the visit has enraged activists , who are dismayed that they will not be able to press hu on his country 's abysmal human rights record - and that sarkozy has chosen to keep mum on the matter . sarkozy defended his decision to keep human rights off the menu in favor of economic talks , saying , " when you host someone , you need to receive them well , and it 's not through criticizing people that you move things forward .
it 's by trying to understand them . " sarkozy drew criticism in particular for not speaking out in favor of jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo , whose nobel peace prize enraged beijing when it was announced last month . relations warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese currency is set to be the major topic of discussion at the next g20 summit economic ties and relations between france and china have warmed considerably since 2009 after reaching a low point in 2008 when sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama . on friday , hu is due to meet business leaders for more contracts , visit a war memorial at paris 's arc de triomphe and meet with french prime minister francois fillon before flying south to the riviera city of nice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

studies confirm that psychological problems are on the rise in the state . the rainawari psychiatric hospital in kashmir 's summer capital srinagar always buzzes with activity .
it is one of the few facilities in the region that offers treatment for mental health disorders , many of which have been triggered by kashmir 's separatist conflict . many in the valley have had near-death experiences , or have witnessed people they know being threatened or killed in over 20 years of armed conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 in the kashmir valley has lost family members due to violence over the past 20 years on any given day , hundreds of people line up at the dilapidated building to seek either counselling or medicines for stress and related disorders . 15 percent suffer from anxiety disorder kashmir ’ s noted psychiatrist mushtaq margoob has been seeing patients for over a decade .

it happens every now and then .
yes , i am taking medicine but the fear is still there . " the many shutdowns and curfews in the kashmir valley have also affected the locals psychologically .
the killings of over 110 youths , mostly protestors , in the past few months triggered the biggest anti-india demonstrations in recent years . rise in use of sedatives margoob says the use of sedatives and drugs has gone up : " people cope with the trauma and negative emotional states by using anything , many substances to induce a temporary state of sleep and rest . " a study conducted by independent humanitarian medical aid agency medecins sans frontiers -lrb- msf -rrb- found that a third of respondents suffered from psychological distress . nearly one in 10 reported having lost one or more members of their immediate family due to violence in the period from 1989 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in srinagar is often interrupted by strikes and protests another independent study showed that 29 percent of unemployed males in kashmir smoked to relax and nearly 12 percent of the population , including women , took sleeping pills to overcome stress .

now the world 's biggest bank by assets , it has adopted a confident swagger , despite the recent crisis . bnp paribas reported on thursday a 46-percent rise in profits for the third quarter and said it would not have to raise more capital to meet new banking standards .
it is another round of good news for a bank which has 34.47 percent in the past three years , becoming the world 's biggest when measured by assets . the paris-based bank has assets of 2.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.21 trillion -rrb- . but as the banking behemoth promises a positive end to this year , some question if it is wise to allow banks to become big enough to put entire sectors , or even economies , at risk should they fail .
that was the fear in the united states in the recent financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system there and led to new banking regulation signed into law this year . but the french appear to be taking a somewhat more laissez-faire attitude , despite concerns about continued risks to financial stability related to europe 's sovereign debt crisis . " i think the french are nervous about it , but they are ignoring the possible problems , " manfred jaeger-ambrozewicz , a banking expert at the cologne institute for business research , told deutsche welle . size does n't matter for now , bnp is smiling and the french government does n't appear eager to step in to break up the bank or impose new regulations , as some other countries are . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is toughening up capital requirements for its banks substantially switzerland is introducing new rules that will curb risks from its biggest banks , calling for substantially higher capital requirements than international rules require . even britain , which has traditionally been hands-off regarding its banks , is examining whether some of its biggest financial institutions should be broken up .
in the us , the new dodd-frank act prohibits banks from trading from their own account . but french bankers have dismissed concerns about size . " size is n't limited to risk , " frederic oudea , the ceo of societe generale , told a parliamentary hearing .
socgen is france 's third-biggest bank by assets . new capital ?
non merci french bankers have also balked at new rules on capital . " asking for more capital is not necessarily more virtuous if it 's simply a counterparty to more risk , " bank of france governor christian noyer said in mid-october .
" if banks in some countries have very risky profiles and regulators ask them to hold more capital , it 's their problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ' prot is one of the few french bank heads to have kept his job through the crisis new banking rules by the basel committee on banking supervision will gradually require banks to hold greater capital buffers to absorb potential losses . called basel iii for short , the new regulations will force banks to hold top-quality capital totaling 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets , more than triple what they do now .
lenders have until 2019 to implement some of the rules . on thursday , as bnp paribas reported its big profits , it also ruled out a capital increase to meet the new industry rules , saying its own revenue generation would allow it to comply with the basel iii requirements . " no capital increase whatsoever , " bnp chief executive baudouin prot told reuters .
" i 'm very confident on the capital position . " several banks across europe have gone to investors for fresh equity as the tighter capital requirements loom . national champions france has a tradition of government involvement in the private sector .
since the 1960s , paris has intervened to save the so-called " national champions , " companies seen as essential to the national economy or the country 's global reputation , and which paris sees as too important to fail . in 2004 , french president nicolas sarkozy led a state bailout of alstrom when he was finance minister and encouraged the nation 's two biggest drug makers to merge in order to put off a bid from swiss competitor novartis . the gallic crowing around banks these days could have to do with protecting prestigious french companies , according to jaeger-ambrozewicz . " i can imagine that the french do n't want to break up this bank , " he said .
" they are saying , ' this is our national champion , the number one in the world by assets . " ' if it 's going well , paris might think the best intervention is no intervention , according to nicolas veron of the brussels-based think tank bruegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hinted it would intervene in the case of societe general back in 2008 but that does n't mean the french government has adopted a policy of allowing the market to operate freely in every case .
he pointed to societe generale 's problems in 2008 when it lost 5 billion euros due to a " rogue " trader .
during the crisis , the french prime minister insisted that no matter what , the bank would remain french . " i would argue that economic nationalism is at least as strong in the banking sector in france as in other sectors , " veron told deutsche welle . doing well french banks in general , and bnp paribas in particular , weathered the financial crisis better than their rivals in other countries .
banking assets in france rose 41 percent between 2005 and 2009 , to 7.16 trillion euros , according to the european central bank .
that is almost four times france 's gdp . " -lrb- bnp paris -rrb- is one of those banks which emerged from the crisis as a winner , as things currently stand .
it certainly strengthened its european market share and did n't take any visible big hits , " veron said . the four biggest french banks - bnp paribas , credit agricole , societe generale and groupe bpce - all passed eu stress tests in july .
the inquiries looked at whether banks had enough capital to outlast an economic slowdown and sovereign debt crisis , although some analysts argued the tests were not rigorous enough . that makes analysts like jaeger-ambrozewicz slightly worried .
he said he fears that banks , both in france and in europe as a whole , might be overconfident and not have learned from the crisis . " banks now look healthier than they really are .
the problem of systemic risk has not really been addressed yet , " he said .
" the question is how to do that without destroying the big banks or causing them real problems . " author : kyle james editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is another round of good news for a bank which has 34.47 percent in the past three years , becoming the world 's biggest when measured by assets . the paris-based bank has assets of 2.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.21 trillion -rrb- . but as the banking behemoth promises a positive end to this year , some question if it is wise to allow banks to become big enough to put entire sectors , or even economies , at risk should they fail .
that was the fear in the united states in the recent financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system there and led to new banking regulation signed into law this year . but the french appear to be taking a somewhat more laissez-faire attitude , despite concerns about continued risks to financial stability related to europe 's sovereign debt crisis . " i think the french are nervous about it , but they are ignoring the possible problems , " manfred jaeger-ambrozewicz , a banking expert at the cologne institute for business research , told deutsche welle . size does n't matter for now , bnp is smiling and the french government does n't appear eager to step in to break up the bank or impose new regulations , as some other countries are . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is toughening up capital requirements for its banks substantially switzerland is introducing new rules that will curb risks from its biggest banks , calling for substantially higher capital requirements than international rules require . even britain , which has traditionally been hands-off regarding its banks , is examining whether some of its biggest financial institutions should be broken up .
in the us , the new dodd-frank act prohibits banks from trading from their own account . but french bankers have dismissed concerns about size . " size is n't limited to risk , " frederic oudea , the ceo of societe generale , told a parliamentary hearing .
socgen is france 's third-biggest bank by assets . new capital ?
non merci french bankers have also balked at new rules on capital . " asking for more capital is not necessarily more virtuous if it 's simply a counterparty to more risk , " bank of france governor christian noyer said in mid-october .
" if banks in some countries have very risky profiles and regulators ask them to hold more capital , it 's their problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ' prot is one of the few french bank heads to have kept his job through the crisis new banking rules by the basel committee on banking supervision will gradually require banks to hold greater capital buffers to absorb potential losses . called basel iii for short , the new regulations will force banks to hold top-quality capital totaling 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets , more than triple what they do now .
lenders have until 2019 to implement some of the rules . on thursday , as bnp paribas reported its big profits , it also ruled out a capital increase to meet the new industry rules , saying its own revenue generation would allow it to comply with the basel iii requirements . " no capital increase whatsoever , " bnp chief executive baudouin prot told reuters .
" i 'm very confident on the capital position . " several banks across europe have gone to investors for fresh equity as the tighter capital requirements loom . national champions france has a tradition of government involvement in the private sector .
since the 1960s , paris has intervened to save the so-called " national champions , " companies seen as essential to the national economy or the country 's global reputation , and which paris sees as too important to fail . in 2004 , french president nicolas sarkozy led a state bailout of alstrom when he was finance minister and encouraged the nation 's two biggest drug makers to merge in order to put off a bid from swiss competitor novartis . the gallic crowing around banks these days could have to do with protecting prestigious french companies , according to jaeger-ambrozewicz . " i can imagine that the french do n't want to break up this bank , " he said .
" they are saying , ' this is our national champion , the number one in the world by assets . " ' if it 's going well , paris might think the best intervention is no intervention , according to nicolas veron of the brussels-based think tank bruegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hinted it would intervene in the case of societe general back in 2008 but that does n't mean the french government has adopted a policy of allowing the market to operate freely in every case .
he pointed to societe generale 's problems in 2008 when it lost 5 billion euros due to a " rogue " trader .
during the crisis , the french prime minister insisted that no matter what , the bank would remain french . " i would argue that economic nationalism is at least as strong in the banking sector in france as in other sectors , " veron told deutsche welle . doing well french banks in general , and bnp paribas in particular , weathered the financial crisis better than their rivals in other countries .
banking assets in france rose 41 percent between 2005 and 2009 , to 7.16 trillion euros , according to the european central bank .
that is almost four times france 's gdp . " -lrb- bnp paris -rrb- is one of those banks which emerged from the crisis as a winner , as things currently stand .
it certainly strengthened its european market share and did n't take any visible big hits , " veron said . the four biggest french banks - bnp paribas , credit agricole , societe generale and groupe bpce - all passed eu stress tests in july .
the inquiries looked at whether banks had enough capital to outlast an economic slowdown and sovereign debt crisis , although some analysts argued the tests were not rigorous enough . that makes analysts like jaeger-ambrozewicz slightly worried .
he said he fears that banks , both in france and in europe as a whole , might be overconfident and not have learned from the crisis . " banks now look healthier than they really are .
the problem of systemic risk has not really been addressed yet , " he said .
" the question is how to do that without destroying the big banks or causing them real problems . " author : kyle james editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 04.11.2010 by luck or judgment , van gaal has bayern back on course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free-scoring gomez is proving his worth to his coach forced for months to withstand talk of " crisis , " bundesliga giant bayern munich are beginning to stir .
with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 04.11.2010 germany 's strategic search to secure raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iron ore is essential to germany 's engineering sector germany is one of the highest consumers of raw materials in the world .
and while it has ample reserves of coal , potash , salt and sand , the nation has to import the resources needed to make hi-tech goods . without the likes of copper , cobalt , platinum and the group of minerals known as " rare earths " , the technology industry would never have advanced to the heady heights from which it turns its tidy profit today .
although germany is a major player in the fields of electronics and engineering , it is heavily dependent on imports for raw materials .
thyssenkrupp is a good example .
the steel manufacturer is germany 's biggest , but in order to hang on to that superlative title , it needs steady access to iron ore .
that makes it beholden to an oligopoly of three mining companies , which recently decided to dispense with the 50-year-old tradition of fixing prices on an annual basis .
they now set prices every quarter , and the prices have become very elastic .
this picture is not exclusive to the iron ore industry , but is repeated across the rare earths spectrum , and is a problem for companies dedicated to making future technologies .
without metal there will be no wind turbines ; without lithium and copper , no batteries for electric cars ; without the 17 rare minerals with various electric and magnetic properties , no photovoltaic cells .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts fear china may block western nations ' access to rare earths playing hardball the first port of call for companies seeking to buy most metallic commodities is china .
once upon a time , the country was happy to export its valuable resources , but as ulrich grillo , chairman of the raw materials committee of the federation of german industry told deutsche welle , that has changed in recent months .
" back in july , china said it would reduce production for the second half of the year by 64 percent , " he said , adding that the china daily newspaper reported exports of rare earths will cut by 30 percent in 2011 .
" this report has not yet been denied . "
the german photovoltaic industry has already been affected by the scarcity of lanthan , and consequently been forced it to slow down its production of solar panels .
it 's one of many examples that lead grillo to believe raw materials are being misused as geo-strategic tools .
" more and more countries in europe and in all other continents need resources for their own development , " the expert said .
" they want to be a part of industrial production , growth and affluence , and that is their legitimate right . "
from america to china grillo says in imposing trade restrictions such as export quotas and tariffs , important emerging markets are subsidizing their own industries and warping international competition .
but industrialized countries are not without blame for the current situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is a rare earth used in computer components as recently as 1990 , more than one third of rare earths on the market came from the united states .
but their toxicity and dispersal makes mining them an expensive business .
as a result , us companies decided to close down their shafts and buy the minerals from china , which was selling rare earths cheaply at the time .
but recent developments have prompted a change in thinking and several mining companies have announced new plans to go back underground in search of rare earths .
and when they do , german economics minister rainer bruederle would like to see german companies get involved .
but the president of the federation of german industries -lrb- dbi -rrb- , hans-peter keitel , says it will take more than investments to secure 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- worth of raw materials annually .
" we could ask ourselves what political interests a region like central asia has , " keitel said .
" maybe there are political wishes we could help to fulfill in exchange for the procurement of raw materials . "
new strategies desired keitel believes it is crucial to develop of a new strategy for dealing with china and the sale of its resources .
" without endorsing protectionism , we could consider whether china might not actually be within its rights to say it does n't want to sell its raw materials for money and yet more money " keitel said .
" is n't this about partnership ?
is n't our technology really our currency ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a lot to offer besides solar power technology he says germany should be looking at which of its technologies it is willing to export in exchange for raw materials .
at the end of october , the german government signed off on a raw materials strategy which sets out plans for partnerships between the foreign , economics and development ministries with resource-rich developing and emerging nations .
development minister dirk niebel says he would like to see germany help establish emerging nations in the international raw materials economy .
" i am interested in value-based and interest-based development cooperation , " the minister said , explaining that it is in germany 's interests to help its partners develop and stand on their own feet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 04.11.2010 germany 's strategic search to secure raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iron ore is essential to germany 's engineering sector germany is one of the highest consumers of raw materials in the world .
and while it has ample reserves of coal , potash , salt and sand , the nation has to import the resources needed to make hi-tech goods . without the likes of copper , cobalt , platinum and the group of minerals known as " rare earths " , the technology industry would never have advanced to the heady heights from which it turns its tidy profit today .
although germany is a major player in the fields of electronics and engineering , it is heavily dependent on imports for raw materials .
thyssenkrupp is a good example .
the steel manufacturer is germany 's biggest , but in order to hang on to that superlative title , it needs steady access to iron ore .
that makes it beholden to an oligopoly of three mining companies , which recently decided to dispense with the 50-year-old tradition of fixing prices on an annual basis .
they now set prices every quarter , and the prices have become very elastic .
this picture is not exclusive to the iron ore industry , but is repeated across the rare earths spectrum , and is a problem for companies dedicated to making future technologies .
without metal there will be no wind turbines ; without lithium and copper , no batteries for electric cars ; without the 17 rare minerals with various electric and magnetic properties , no photovoltaic cells .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts fear china may block western nations ' access to rare earths playing hardball the first port of call for companies seeking to buy most metallic commodities is china .
once upon a time , the country was happy to export its valuable resources , but as ulrich grillo , chairman of the raw materials committee of the federation of german industry told deutsche welle , that has changed in recent months .
" back in july , china said it would reduce production for the second half of the year by 64 percent , " he said , adding that the china daily newspaper reported exports of rare earths will cut by 30 percent in 2011 .
" this report has not yet been denied . "
the german photovoltaic industry has already been affected by the scarcity of lanthan , and consequently been forced it to slow down its production of solar panels .
it 's one of many examples that lead grillo to believe raw materials are being misused as geo-strategic tools .
" more and more countries in europe and in all other continents need resources for their own development , " the expert said .
" they want to be a part of industrial production , growth and affluence , and that is their legitimate right . "
from america to china grillo says in imposing trade restrictions such as export quotas and tariffs , important emerging markets are subsidizing their own industries and warping international competition .
but industrialized countries are not without blame for the current situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is a rare earth used in computer components as recently as 1990 , more than one third of rare earths on the market came from the united states .
but their toxicity and dispersal makes mining them an expensive business .
as a result , us companies decided to close down their shafts and buy the minerals from china , which was selling rare earths cheaply at the time .
but recent developments have prompted a change in thinking and several mining companies have announced new plans to go back underground in search of rare earths .
and when they do , german economics minister rainer bruederle would like to see german companies get involved .
but the president of the federation of german industries -lrb- dbi -rrb- , hans-peter keitel , says it will take more than investments to secure 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- worth of raw materials annually .
" we could ask ourselves what political interests a region like central asia has , " keitel said .
" maybe there are political wishes we could help to fulfill in exchange for the procurement of raw materials . "
new strategies desired keitel believes it is crucial to develop of a new strategy for dealing with china and the sale of its resources .
" without endorsing protectionism , we could consider whether china might not actually be within its rights to say it does n't want to sell its raw materials for money and yet more money " keitel said .
" is n't this about partnership ?
is n't our technology really our currency ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a lot to offer besides solar power technology he says germany should be looking at which of its technologies it is willing to export in exchange for raw materials .
at the end of october , the german government signed off on a raw materials strategy which sets out plans for partnerships between the foreign , economics and development ministries with resource-rich developing and emerging nations .
development minister dirk niebel says he would like to see germany help establish emerging nations in the international raw materials economy .
" i am interested in value-based and interest-based development cooperation , " the minister said , explaining that it is in germany 's interests to help its partners develop and stand on their own feet .
" on the other hand , it is also in germany 's interest to ensure that what is organized here with taxpayers ' money flows back into german society with added value . "
the strategy makes sense because germany is set to remain at least partially dependent upon chinese raw materials in the future .
without them much of the nation 's industry would quite simply grind to a halt .

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .
" not just something that is negative and related to persecution and the holocaust , but a positive identity . " liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .

gomez contributed with a hat trick , helping his team to the champions league knockout stages . bayern munich striker mario gomez scored a hat trick in his club 's champions league group stage win over romanian team cfr cluj on wednesday night , earning bayern a place in the knockout stages with two games to spare .
gomez had a rare place in the starting 11 and was quick to make the most of it .
a shot from andreas ottl after 12 minutes was parried by cluj goalkeeper eduard stancoiu into the path of gomez , who tapped the ball home .

the romanian side showed some signs of a fight back , and were dominant in the first part of the second half - but to no avail .
bayern 's third came after 71 minutes after a through-ball from schweinsteiger pierced the defense to give gomez a clear shot on goal - which he duly converted .
mueller puts icing on cake thomas mueller topped off the germans ’ victory , pouncing on a blunder in the cluj defense to score a tap-in in the final minute .

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .
" not just something that is negative and related to persecution and the holocaust , but a positive identity . " liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .
the ordination of germany 's first female rabbi comes 38 years after the us first witnessed its first ordination of a female rabbi . author : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- reuters , epd , ap , dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .

the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .

back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .

hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused . " german data protection authorities are currently investigating possible privacy violations by google , after the company admitted last month that it had captured some e-mails and passwords through open wi-fi networks in the course taking pictures for street view . along with the images of oberstaufen , google also launched various images of public spaces across germany . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted . " but it 's doubtable if that would be a feature social networks would actually welcome , " hoeren added .
" what happens if you forget about the deadline you set and half of your page has been raided ? " the new rules will form the basis for an overhaul of the eu 's laws on data protection scheduled for next year . the approach comes at a time when britain ruled google had breached uk law by harvesting emails , internet addresses and passwords while collecting data for its street view mapping service .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

leverkusen stay top of group b , but trainer jupp heynckes was n't pleased with the performance on the pitch , calling it the team 's " worst game this season . "
borussia dortmund , meanwhile , could only manage a goalless draw on their trip to france to face paris st germain . " the whole time , i kept thinking we would score a goal , " said defender neven subotic .

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 04.11.2010 germany 's strategic search to secure raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iron ore is essential to germany 's engineering sector germany is one of the highest consumers of raw materials in the world .
and while it has ample reserves of coal , potash , salt and sand , the nation has to import the resources needed to make hi-tech goods . without the likes of copper , cobalt , platinum and the group of minerals known as " rare earths " , the technology industry would never have advanced to the heady heights from which it turns its tidy profit today .
although germany is a major player in the fields of electronics and engineering , it is heavily dependent on imports for raw materials .
thyssenkrupp is a good example .
the steel manufacturer is germany 's biggest , but in order to hang on to that superlative title , it needs steady access to iron ore .
that makes it beholden to an oligopoly of three mining companies , which recently decided to dispense with the 50-year-old tradition of fixing prices on an annual basis .
they now set prices every quarter , and the prices have become very elastic .
this picture is not exclusive to the iron ore industry , but is repeated across the rare earths spectrum , and is a problem for companies dedicated to making future technologies .
without metal there will be no wind turbines ; without lithium and copper , no batteries for electric cars ; without the 17 rare minerals with various electric and magnetic properties , no photovoltaic cells .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts fear china may block western nations ' access to rare earths playing hardball the first port of call for companies seeking to buy most metallic commodities is china .
once upon a time , the country was happy to export its valuable resources , but as ulrich grillo , chairman of the raw materials committee of the federation of german industry told deutsche welle , that has changed in recent months .
" back in july , china said it would reduce production for the second half of the year by 64 percent , " he said , adding that the china daily newspaper reported exports of rare earths will cut by 30 percent in 2011 .
" this report has not yet been denied . "
the german photovoltaic industry has already been affected by the scarcity of lanthan , and consequently been forced it to slow down its production of solar panels .
it 's one of many examples that lead grillo to believe raw materials are being misused as geo-strategic tools .
" more and more countries in europe and in all other continents need resources for their own development , " the expert said .
" they want to be a part of industrial production , growth and affluence , and that is their legitimate right . "
from america to china grillo says in imposing trade restrictions such as export quotas and tariffs , important emerging markets are subsidizing their own industries and warping international competition .
but industrialized countries are not without blame for the current situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is a rare earth used in computer components as recently as 1990 , more than one third of rare earths on the market came from the united states .
but their toxicity and dispersal makes mining them an expensive business .
as a result , us companies decided to close down their shafts and buy the minerals from china , which was selling rare earths cheaply at the time .
but recent developments have prompted a change in thinking and several mining companies have announced new plans to go back underground in search of rare earths .
and when they do , german economics minister rainer bruederle would like to see german companies get involved .
but the president of the federation of german industries -lrb- dbi -rrb- , hans-peter keitel , says it will take more than investments to secure 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- worth of raw materials annually .
" we could ask ourselves what political interests a region like central asia has , " keitel said .
" maybe there are political wishes we could help to fulfill in exchange for the procurement of raw materials . "
new strategies desired keitel believes it is crucial to develop of a new strategy for dealing with china and the sale of its resources .
" without endorsing protectionism , we could consider whether china might not actually be within its rights to say it does n't want to sell its raw materials for money and yet more money " keitel said .
" is n't this about partnership ?
is n't our technology really our currency ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a lot to offer besides solar power technology he says germany should be looking at which of its technologies it is willing to export in exchange for raw materials .
at the end of october , the german government signed off on a raw materials strategy which sets out plans for partnerships between the foreign , economics and development ministries with resource-rich developing and emerging nations .
development minister dirk niebel says he would like to see germany help establish emerging nations in the international raw materials economy .
" i am interested in value-based and interest-based development cooperation , " the minister said , explaining that it is in germany 's interests to help its partners develop and stand on their own feet .
" on the other hand , it is also in germany 's interest to ensure that what is organized here with taxpayers ' money flows back into german society with added value . "
the strategy makes sense because germany is set to remain at least partially dependent upon chinese raw materials in the future .
without them much of the nation 's industry would quite simply grind to a halt .

in the 56-page document , koenigshaus expressed frustration that equipment shortfall issues that had previously been brought up by reinhold robbe , koenigshaus 's predecessor as parliamentary armed forces commissioner , had not been adequately addressed .
ied vulnerability this includes a lack of protection for german troops searching for ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
the current practice for german soldiers is to search for the devices on foot , a tedious and dangerous process that makes them an easy target for the bombs , which are often concealed along roads and paths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arguments by koenigshaus have been made before a solution suggested by koenigshaus would be providing the bundeswehr with armed vehicles that are outfitted with equipment to detect ieds .
american forces in afghanistan use such vehicles , and while they are not completely protected from an ied blast , they are safer than foot patrols .
" we have to do a better job of protecting our soldiers who are detecting and disposing of explosive devices , " koenigshaus said .
" there are products on the market that would help us do that . "
' ongoing process ' after koenigshaus brought up the issue of the vehicles in a different report in june , the defense ministry had decided to develop its own vehicles that would be available by 2016 .
however , a temporary solution has been found in the meantime that would be available to soldiers by 2011 .
during an unannounced visit with isaf forces in afghanistan on his way home from meetings in china , german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said " improving -lsb- how troops are -rsb- equipped is an ongoing process . " he added that he welcomed contributions from anyone willing to help in that process , and koenigshaus was doing just that .

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they may be well-qualified , but they often earn less than 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,400 dollars -rrb- a month . after years of working long hours for low pay , an estimated 3,500 czech doctors are threatening to quit by the end of the year and join an exodus to western europe .
many earn less than skilled carpenters or plumbers , and face government austerity measures that will cut health care funds even further . neighboring germany , where a recent study by the hospital institute estimated that there was a shortfall of 5,500 doctors , is interested in recruiting disgruntled czech medics .
representatives from some 30 german clinics visited prague at the end of october , with the aim of filling more than 100 vacancies back in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs over 5,000 more doctors lucie and evzen gorbunov were among those at the german jobs fair in prague .
lucie is a 28-year-old anesthetist ; her husband evzen is a surgeon .
they 've had enough of the conditions in czech health care . " i finished my medical degree two years ago , " lucie gorbunov said .
" the working conditions are really bad : lots of night shifts , not enough pay .
if i work an extra six to seven nights in a month i get around 25,000 crowns net , which works out at roughly 1,000 euros a month . " most young czech doctors have to do extra shifts or take a second job just to keep their heads above water .
according to evzen gorbunov , low wages are only part of the problem : " as a young doctor i 'm in a difficult position , " he said .
" it 's very hard to progress here .
in the first year we 're often kept busy with bureaucracy , forms and calculations , and we have little contact with patients .
young surgeons are only allowed to observe operations and pass instruments to the head surgeon in the first few years . " ' thanks , we 're leaving ' that 's why thousands of czech doctors have launched an initiative called " thanks , we 're leaving . "

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 04.11.2010 germany 's strategic search to secure raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iron ore is essential to germany 's engineering sector germany is one of the highest consumers of raw materials in the world .
and while it has ample reserves of coal , potash , salt and sand , the nation has to import the resources needed to make hi-tech goods . without the likes of copper , cobalt , platinum and the group of minerals known as " rare earths " , the technology industry would never have advanced to the heady heights from which it turns its tidy profit today .
although germany is a major player in the fields of electronics and engineering , it is heavily dependent on imports for raw materials .
thyssenkrupp is a good example .
the steel manufacturer is germany 's biggest , but in order to hang on to that superlative title , it needs steady access to iron ore .
that makes it beholden to an oligopoly of three mining companies , which recently decided to dispense with the 50-year-old tradition of fixing prices on an annual basis .
they now set prices every quarter , and the prices have become very elastic .
this picture is not exclusive to the iron ore industry , but is repeated across the rare earths spectrum , and is a problem for companies dedicated to making future technologies .
without metal there will be no wind turbines ; without lithium and copper , no batteries for electric cars ; without the 17 rare minerals with various electric and magnetic properties , no photovoltaic cells .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts fear china may block western nations ' access to rare earths playing hardball the first port of call for companies seeking to buy most metallic commodities is china .
once upon a time , the country was happy to export its valuable resources , but as ulrich grillo , chairman of the raw materials committee of the federation of german industry told deutsche welle , that has changed in recent months .
" back in july , china said it would reduce production for the second half of the year by 64 percent , " he said , adding that the china daily newspaper reported exports of rare earths will cut by 30 percent in 2011 .
" this report has not yet been denied . "
the german photovoltaic industry has already been affected by the scarcity of lanthan , and consequently been forced it to slow down its production of solar panels .
it 's one of many examples that lead grillo to believe raw materials are being misused as geo-strategic tools .
" more and more countries in europe and in all other continents need resources for their own development , " the expert said .
" they want to be a part of industrial production , growth and affluence , and that is their legitimate right . "
from america to china grillo says in imposing trade restrictions such as export quotas and tariffs , important emerging markets are subsidizing their own industries and warping international competition .
but industrialized countries are not without blame for the current situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is a rare earth used in computer components as recently as 1990 , more than one third of rare earths on the market came from the united states .
but their toxicity and dispersal makes mining them an expensive business .
as a result , us companies decided to close down their shafts and buy the minerals from china , which was selling rare earths cheaply at the time .
but recent developments have prompted a change in thinking and several mining companies have announced new plans to go back underground in search of rare earths .
and when they do , german economics minister rainer bruederle would like to see german companies get involved .
but the president of the federation of german industries -lrb- dbi -rrb- , hans-peter keitel , says it will take more than investments to secure 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 112 billion -rrb- worth of raw materials annually .
" we could ask ourselves what political interests a region like central asia has , " keitel said .
" maybe there are political wishes we could help to fulfill in exchange for the procurement of raw materials . "
new strategies desired keitel believes it is crucial to develop of a new strategy for dealing with china and the sale of its resources .
" without endorsing protectionism , we could consider whether china might not actually be within its rights to say it does n't want to sell its raw materials for money and yet more money " keitel said .
" is n't this about partnership ?
is n't our technology really our currency ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a lot to offer besides solar power technology he says germany should be looking at which of its technologies it is willing to export in exchange for raw materials .
at the end of october , the german government signed off on a raw materials strategy which sets out plans for partnerships between the foreign , economics and development ministries with resource-rich developing and emerging nations .
development minister dirk niebel says he would like to see germany help establish emerging nations in the international raw materials economy .
" i am interested in value-based and interest-based development cooperation , " the minister said , explaining that it is in germany 's interests to help its partners develop and stand on their own feet .
" on the other hand , it is also in germany 's interest to ensure that what is organized here with taxpayers ' money flows back into german society with added value . "
the strategy makes sense because germany is set to remain at least partially dependent upon chinese raw materials in the future .
without them much of the nation 's industry would quite simply grind to a halt .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 04.11.2010 by luck or judgment , van gaal has bayern back on course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free-scoring gomez is proving his worth to his coach forced for months to withstand talk of " crisis , " bundesliga giant bayern munich are beginning to stir .
with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .
" not just something that is negative and related to persecution and the holocaust , but a positive identity . " liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .
the ordination of germany 's first female rabbi comes 38 years after the us first witnessed its first ordination of a female rabbi . author : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- reuters , epd , ap , dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 56-page document , koenigshaus expressed frustration that equipment shortfall issues that had previously been brought up by reinhold robbe , koenigshaus 's predecessor as parliamentary armed forces commissioner , had not been adequately addressed .
ied vulnerability this includes a lack of protection for german troops searching for ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
the current practice for german soldiers is to search for the devices on foot , a tedious and dangerous process that makes them an easy target for the bombs , which are often concealed along roads and paths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arguments by koenigshaus have been made before a solution suggested by koenigshaus would be providing the bundeswehr with armed vehicles that are outfitted with equipment to detect ieds .
american forces in afghanistan use such vehicles , and while they are not completely protected from an ied blast , they are safer than foot patrols .
" we have to do a better job of protecting our soldiers who are detecting and disposing of explosive devices , " koenigshaus said .
" there are products on the market that would help us do that . "
' ongoing process ' after koenigshaus brought up the issue of the vehicles in a different report in june , the defense ministry had decided to develop its own vehicles that would be available by 2016 .
however , a temporary solution has been found in the meantime that would be available to soldiers by 2011 .
during an unannounced visit with isaf forces in afghanistan on his way home from meetings in china , german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said " improving -lsb- how troops are -rsb- equipped is an ongoing process . " he added that he welcomed contributions from anyone willing to help in that process , and koenigshaus was doing just that .

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .

" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .

middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .

" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims .

in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic .

tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused . " german data protection authorities are currently investigating possible privacy violations by google , after the company admitted last month that it had captured some e-mails and passwords through open wi-fi networks in the course taking pictures for street view . along with the images of oberstaufen , google also launched various images of public spaces across germany . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused . " german data protection authorities are currently investigating possible privacy violations by google , after the company admitted last month that it had captured some e-mails and passwords through open wi-fi networks in the course taking pictures for street view . along with the images of oberstaufen , google also launched various images of public spaces across germany . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused . " german data protection authorities are currently investigating possible privacy violations by google , after the company admitted last month that it had captured some e-mails and passwords through open wi-fi networks in the course taking pictures for street view . along with the images of oberstaufen , google also launched various images of public spaces across germany . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.11.2010 nile water : an increasingly precious and contentious commodity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egypt has been dependent on the nile for centuries for thousands of years , egypt has been dependent on the nile and it uses the lion 's share of the river 's water .
however , other african countries are demanding a fairer approach to sharing the river . in the nile delta town of new nubaria , about 80 kilometers from the mediterranean , donkeys , cattle and goats seek shelter in the shade of date palms .
around them , black irrigation tubes stick out of the hot sand .
it was here that , in the 1980s , the government turned 250,000 hectares of desert into arable land for 200,000 poor farmers , selling them the land for cheap . today , though , many of these farmers have lost hope .
" i planted melons and peanuts , but only two years later , i was not able to use my land any more , " said abdel chatr , who has been farming in this inhospitable region for 23 years .
" since then i have been working as a day laborer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling water flows are increasing salinity as the mediterranean sea encroaches into the nile delta around 15 percent of the once-arable land in new nubaria is no longer usable , because the ground water level is too high and the water too salty .
less water from the nile is flowing into the mediterranean , so more and more salt water flows back into the country , part of which lies under sea level .
it 's just one of the issues around nile river water that analysts fear could spark conflict if they go unresolved .
precious resource growing scarcer egypt depends on the nile for over 80 percent of its water needs , but rapid population increases have resulted in growing water scarcity .
the average egyptian has access to 30 percent less water than un estimates say is necessary for basic needs .
" our nile water quote of 55.5 billion cubic meters a year was sufficient for egypt 's 1959 population of 24 million , " said nasreddin allam , minister of water resources and irrigation .
" but today the national population stands at 80 million . "
even farmers who 've made a good living off the fertile soil in the nile delta are angry .
one such farmer is hajid gnedi , who owns five hectares .
he says he feels harassed by egyptian authorities who have begun rationing the water that flows into his canals .
gnedi says upstream countries like ethiopia and uganda are taking more water from the nile than they are entitled to .
" if i were the egyptian president , i would not allow these countries to blackmail us , to make us suffer and to allow less and less water into the nile , " he said .
" egypt has a right to its share of this water . "
water allocation row the question is , how much is egypt 's share ?
egypt has its rights to nile water guaranteed in many international agreements , including a 1929 treaty with then-colonial power great britain .
egypt and sudan are currently entitled to almost 90 percent of the nile 's flow of 84 billion cubic liters a year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nile basic countries but the nile flows through nine countries , and many of those upstream say while egypt benefits from the nile 's flow , they live in countries often ravaged by drought .
ethiopia , kenya , rwanda , tanzania and uganda – all upstream and poorer countries – signed a new agreement this year which they say will provide for a more equitable sharing of the river water .
addis ababa plans to building dams on the river and export power to other countries .
it also wants to set up irrigation projects to prevent famine .
but egypt and sudan are firmly opposed to any new water allocation .
the two countries are almost completely dependent on the nile for their fresh water and they say upstream projects would drastically reduce the river 's flow , which could be catastrophic for them .
the disagreements between the downstream states of egypt and sudan and upstream members of the nile river basin initiative over allocating nile water are to be discussed at a meeting in nairobi later this month .
but with populations growing in all of the nine countries that lie along the nile , conflict over the world 's biggest river is likely to continue .
other issues but water allocation is not the only issue .
residue from fertilizer and pesticides , and waste water from greater cairo , flow largely untreated into the nile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inflows from cairo have severely polluted the waters in the nile delta the water in the nile delta is now so polluted that liver diseases are on the rise and life expectancy has begun to drop .
according to paul weber , a consultant working in egypt for the german development group gtz , if egypt does not address water scarcity and population growth , living conditions will deteriorate further .
" the population -lrb- in egypt -rrb- is growing by 1.6 million people every year .
no government and no international cooperation can create enough jobs outside traditional areas like agriculture to provide jobs for all young people , " he said .
" there 's a lot of unrest below the surface . "

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .

" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .

" liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .

with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused . " german data protection authorities are currently investigating possible privacy violations by google , after the company admitted last month that it had captured some e-mails and passwords through open wi-fi networks in the course taking pictures for street view . along with the images of oberstaufen , google also launched various images of public spaces across germany . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 04.11.2010 by luck or judgment , van gaal has bayern back on course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free-scoring gomez is proving his worth to his coach forced for months to withstand talk of " crisis , " bundesliga giant bayern munich are beginning to stir .
with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 04.11.2010 by luck or judgment , van gaal has bayern back on course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free-scoring gomez is proving his worth to his coach forced for months to withstand talk of " crisis , " bundesliga giant bayern munich are beginning to stir .
with champions league progress now secure , the bavarians may get down to business - and rip through the league . crisis ?
what crisis ?
how it easy it now seems to brush off those initial flippant remarks about bayern munich 's early form with a dismissive hand now that the bavarian giants seem to have their season back on track .
just a few weeks ago , pundits - this one included - were questioning the quality of the german champions .
after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans were on their knees waiting for robben 's return it was a lack of depth , we cried .
we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .
" not just something that is negative and related to persecution and the holocaust , but a positive identity . " liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .
the ordination of germany 's first female rabbi comes 38 years after the us first witnessed its first ordination of a female rabbi . author : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- reuters , epd , ap , dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

alina treiger , 31 , will have the same rights and responsibilities as her male colleagues . alina treiger is the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in germany in 75 years .
she and two male rabbis were ordained in an emotional ceremony attended by german president christian wulff and jewish leaders from around the world at berlin 's pestalozzi synagogue on thursday . jewish life has taken root again in germany after being nearly wiped out by the nazis . " for the past two years , rabbis have been ordained here in germany , rabbis who completed their studies in germany , " wulff said . ukrainian-born treiger studied at the abraham geiger college in berlin , which was founded in 1999 , and is due to take up her post as rabbi in jewish religious communities in the towns of oldenburg and delmenhorst . " it 's important to me that jews in germany are able to develop a positive identity , " she said .
" not just something that is negative and related to persecution and the holocaust , but a positive identity . " liberal judaism considers men and women to be equal , and she was made to feel very welcome , treiger told deutsche welle ahead of the ceremony . " this shows that the attitude towards female rabbis has changed to the better , " she said . no difference between male and female rabbis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alina treiger studied for five years at abraham geiger college as a rabbi , treiger will not only read from the torah and give religious lessons , but also conduct marriages and funerals , and sit on rabbinical courts . " i hope that the women in the jewish community see that it is possible , as a woman , to take an active part in learning and studying our texts and sources , " she said . before coming to germany , treiger worked in jewish organizations in ukraine and russia .
in her hometown poltava , she headed the jewish community 's congregation programs . " at that time , in the year 2000 , the world union of progressive judaism was looking for young people willing to do rabbinic training , " she said .
" i was asked and said ‘ yes . '
so , i went to berlin to study . " treiger 's ordination was the first in germany since regina jonas became the world 's first female rabbi in 1935 .
jonas , who grew up in berlin and was trained there , was murdered at the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1944 . germany 's jewish community now counts nearly 110,000 members .
after the fall of the berlin wall , germany made it easier for jews from the former soviet union to immigrate and obtain citizenship .
currently around 50 of the 110 jewish community congregations do not have a rabbi . today , germany - the birthplace of liberal judaism - still lags behind other countries in ordaining female rabbis .
the ordination of germany 's first female rabbi comes 38 years after the us first witnessed its first ordination of a female rabbi . author : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- reuters , epd , ap , dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 56-page document , koenigshaus expressed frustration that equipment shortfall issues that had previously been brought up by reinhold robbe , koenigshaus 's predecessor as parliamentary armed forces commissioner , had not been adequately addressed .
ied vulnerability this includes a lack of protection for german troops searching for ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
the current practice for german soldiers is to search for the devices on foot , a tedious and dangerous process that makes them an easy target for the bombs , which are often concealed along roads and paths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arguments by koenigshaus have been made before a solution suggested by koenigshaus would be providing the bundeswehr with armed vehicles that are outfitted with equipment to detect ieds .
american forces in afghanistan use such vehicles , and while they are not completely protected from an ied blast , they are safer than foot patrols .
" we have to do a better job of protecting our soldiers who are detecting and disposing of explosive devices , " koenigshaus said .
" there are products on the market that would help us do that . "
' ongoing process ' after koenigshaus brought up the issue of the vehicles in a different report in june , the defense ministry had decided to develop its own vehicles that would be available by 2016 .
however , a temporary solution has been found in the meantime that would be available to soldiers by 2011 .
during an unannounced visit with isaf forces in afghanistan on his way home from meetings in china , german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said " improving -lsb- how troops are -rsb- equipped is an ongoing process . " he added that he welcomed contributions from anyone willing to help in that process , and koenigshaus was doing just that .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

gomez contributed with a hat trick , helping his team to the champions league knockout stages . bayern munich striker mario gomez scored a hat trick in his club 's champions league group stage win over romanian team cfr cluj on wednesday night , earning bayern a place in the knockout stages with two games to spare .
gomez had a rare place in the starting 11 and was quick to make the most of it .
a shot from andreas ottl after 12 minutes was parried by cluj goalkeeper eduard stancoiu into the path of gomez , who tapped the ball home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez , right , and bayern can celebrate their best start to a champions league campaign his second came after 24 minutes , when he nudged the ball into the net after receiving a nodded pass from inside the box by germany international bastian schweinsteiger .
the romanian side showed some signs of a fight back , and were dominant in the first part of the second half - but to no avail .
bayern 's third came after 71 minutes after a through-ball from schweinsteiger pierced the defense to give gomez a clear shot on goal - which he duly converted .
mueller puts icing on cake thomas mueller topped off the germans ’ victory , pouncing on a blunder in the cluj defense to score a tap-in in the final minute .

the win gives bayern its best-ever start to the competition , despite the poorest beginning to a bundesliga season in living memory . in tuesday 's champions league soccer , schalke gained only a point with a draw against hapoel tel aviv , while werder bremen were all but eliminated from the next stage with a 2-0 defeat to dutch football champions fc twente . author : richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , reuters -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 04.11.2010 researchers in scotland take one step closer to invisibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new membrane brings invisibility closer to reality who has n't been envious of harry potter when he dons his cloak of invisibility and disappears ?
a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted . " but it 's doubtable if that would be a feature social networks would actually welcome , " hoeren added .
" what happens if you forget about the deadline you set and half of your page has been raided ? " the new rules will form the basis for an overhaul of the eu 's laws on data protection scheduled for next year . the approach comes at a time when britain ruled google had breached uk law by harvesting emails , internet addresses and passwords while collecting data for its street view mapping service .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary .

the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted . " but it 's doubtable if that would be a feature social networks would actually welcome , " hoeren added .
" what happens if you forget about the deadline you set and half of your page has been raided ? " the new rules will form the basis for an overhaul of the eu 's laws on data protection scheduled for next year . the approach comes at a time when britain ruled google had breached uk law by harvesting emails , internet addresses and passwords while collecting data for its street view mapping service .

far-right organizers , including members of the slavic force movement , boasted at least 5,000 for an anti-immigrant rally in a suburb in the city 's south . right-wing extremists shouted " russia for the russians , " and carried banners calling for " white power " and " orthodox faith or death . " " we will show that we are here , that there are not only azerbaijan and armenian organizations , " said slavic union leader dmitry dyomushkin .
" we call all ordinary russians to come out and show you are here , that you exist and that you are the real masters of this land .

however , polls show that only 10 percent of the public knows what the holiday is about . the demonstrators in moscow got support from preston wiginton , an american advocate of white supremacy , who has earlier been refused entrance into the united kingdom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.11.2010 germany raises tax revenue outlook through 2012 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany predicts 15.2 billion more euros in 2010 a panel of german economic experts has significantly upped its forecast for the country 's tax revenue over the next two years , prompting conservative politicians to call for an expedited debate on tax cuts . a stronger-than-expected economic recovery in 2010 led german authorities on thursday to raise their outlook for federal , state and local tax revenue from 2010 through 2012 by a total of 61 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.8 billion -rrb- . the announcement quickly led bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon , a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , to call for an immediate discussion on cutting taxes . " the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .
" tax policy is an important instrument .
it can stimulate growth and in particular unleash further economic output . " budget cuts come first but chancellor angela merkel has resisted calls to cut taxes , saying the government 's first priority should be cutting the state budget . " in this year , we will accrue 50 billion euros more of debt , " she told reporters on thursday .
" that 's a debt level that we have n't had in decades . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble echoed merkel 's sentiment , saying the expected increase in tax revenue only showed that germany 's economic situation was not as dramatic as was previously thought . " we 're on the right path -lrb- with budget cuts -rrb- " he said in berlin on thursday .
" it 's difficult , but we will carry on . " tax overhaul by 2013 any tax cut by merkel 's government would likely be incorporated into a broader simplification of germany 's complex tax code , which fahrenschon called " anti-competitive , not motivating and not transparent . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has resisted cutting taxes , preferring to cut spending first " we ca n't allow increasing wages to be eaten up by taxes , " said fahrenschon , whose csu is the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union .
" i think it 's urgent and necessary that we relieve the taxpayer 's burden and simplify our tax laws . " merkel 's center-right government is mostly in agreement that taxes should eventually be simplified and lowered , but the bavarian csu and the coalition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- appear to be pushing the issue more aggressively . fahrenschon said discussion should begin in 2011 for a tax overhaul in 2012 .
economics minister rainer bruederle of the fdp said he wanted " tax relieve for the middle class " in this legislative period . finance expert for the opposition green party gerhard schick said there was no room for tax relief .
he accused the government of playing a " game of hypocrisy , " planning the tax cuts to coincide with parliamentary elections also in 2013 . barbara hoell of the opposition left party said the increased tax revenue shows that " the cuts in social welfare included in the austerity measures are entirely unnecessary . " short of pre-recession levels thursday 's increased outlook was in comparison to predictions in may , before the german government raised its expected economic growth for 2010 to 3.4 percent from 1.4 percent .
the predictions came from a council of about three dozen experts , including officials from state and federal finance ministries , the german central bank , research institutions , municipalities and the federal statistics office . the council expects increase of 15.2 billion euros in tax revenue this year .
continued growth is likely to increase revenue by 22.4 billion euros for 2011 and by 23.4 billion euros for 2012 . despite the positive figures , the council predicted germany would not recover to pre-recession tax revenue levels until 2012 . author : andrew bowen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google said it was correcting the error . just two days after web giant google introduced the first images of germany in its street view mapping feature , the company partially shut the service down due to an error that temporarily allowed some blurred-out houses to be clearly viewed . google began a trial period of its street view service on tuesday by showing selected streets in the southern town of oberstaufen , which had invited the company to use it as its guinea pig .
amid privacy concerns , google had agreed to blur images of buildings whose owners did not want their property shown . google spokesperson kay oberbeck told deutsche welle in an e-mail statement that users of apple 's iphone and ipad had contacted the company , saying buildings which should have been blurred out were clearly visible for a moment before the pixilation kicked in . " we immediately removed the affected pictures from street view and are currently correcting the program error for apple applications , " oberbeck said .
" we apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused .

sarkozy seeks to strengthen his country 's relations with china prior to france taking over the group of 20 presidency on november 12 , following the g20 summit in south korea . the summit is expected to be a major topic of discussion between the two leaders , as the key issue in south korea will be the exchange rate of the chinese currency .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

in the 56-page document , koenigshaus expressed frustration that equipment shortfall issues that had previously been brought up by reinhold robbe , koenigshaus 's predecessor as parliamentary armed forces commissioner , had not been adequately addressed .
ied vulnerability this includes a lack of protection for german troops searching for ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
the current practice for german soldiers is to search for the devices on foot , a tedious and dangerous process that makes them an easy target for the bombs , which are often concealed along roads and paths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arguments by koenigshaus have been made before a solution suggested by koenigshaus would be providing the bundeswehr with armed vehicles that are outfitted with equipment to detect ieds .
american forces in afghanistan use such vehicles , and while they are not completely protected from an ied blast , they are safer than foot patrols .
" we have to do a better job of protecting our soldiers who are detecting and disposing of explosive devices , " koenigshaus said .
" there are products on the market that would help us do that . "
' ongoing process ' after koenigshaus brought up the issue of the vehicles in a different report in june , the defense ministry had decided to develop its own vehicles that would be available by 2016 .
however , a temporary solution has been found in the meantime that would be available to soldiers by 2011 .
during an unannounced visit with isaf forces in afghanistan on his way home from meetings in china , german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said " improving -lsb- how troops are -rsb- equipped is an ongoing process . " he added that he welcomed contributions from anyone willing to help in that process , and koenigshaus was doing just that .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

shortly after starting his visit to paris , hu signed deals worth $ 20 billion . french president nicolas sarkozy and his chinese counterpart hu jintao solidified their countries ' economic ties thursday during the beginning of hu 's three-day visit to france . hu signed on thursday a series of deals with french airplane and energy firms worth at least $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- . " china should not be seen as a threat but as an opportunity , " sarkozy said prior to hu 's arrival .
sarkozy seeks to strengthen his country 's relations with china prior to france taking over the group of 20 presidency on november 12 , following the g20 summit in south korea . the summit is expected to be a major topic of discussion between the two leaders , as the key issue in south korea will be the exchange rate of the chinese currency .
the us and other industrial nations accuse china of keeping the yuan 's rate artificially low in order to give chinese exports an advantage on the world market . billions in new contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two presidents toasted each other at a state dinner hu 's visit immediately became lucrative for france : sarkozy 's office announced that chinese airlines had agreed to purchase 102 jets from airbus , in a deal worth $ 14 billion alone .

after reviewing french troops , the two leaders paraded down the champs-elysees , where french and chinese flags hung overhead and spectators were held behind barricades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was criticized for not speaking out for imprisoned nobel prize winner liu xiaobo they conducted their first round of talks at the elysee palace before a full state dinner , where the two were set to toast each other in their only scheduled , official public statements during the visit . the two presidents ' choice not to make public statements during the visit has enraged activists , who are dismayed that they will not be able to press hu on his country 's abysmal human rights record - and that sarkozy has chosen to keep mum on the matter . sarkozy defended his decision to keep human rights off the menu in favor of economic talks , saying , " when you host someone , you need to receive them well , and it 's not through criticizing people that you move things forward .
it 's by trying to understand them . " sarkozy drew criticism in particular for not speaking out in favor of jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo , whose nobel peace prize enraged beijing when it was announced last month . relations warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese currency is set to be the major topic of discussion at the next g20 summit economic ties and relations between france and china have warmed considerably since 2009 after reaching a low point in 2008 when sarkozy met with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama . on friday , hu is due to meet business leaders for more contracts , visit a war memorial at paris 's arc de triomphe and meet with french prime minister francois fillon before flying south to the riviera city of nice .

after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?

we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

we lamented van gaal 's frugality in the summer transfer market and the arrogance that prevented him from adding insurance to a team built around fragile yet luminous stars .
we felt hoodwinked when it appeared that our belief in bayern as a great team was revealed to be folly .
they had flattered to deceive .
they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

it is one of the most serious safety incidents to date for the world 's largest passenger plane . a qantas a380 with 459 people on board made an emergency landing in singapore on thursday .
there were no injuries to passengers or crew , officials said .
" we are obviously taking this very seriously , because it was a significant engine failure , " qantas chief executive alan joyce told reporters in sydney .
australia 's qantas airways said it was grounding all six of its a380s - the world 's biggest passenger jet - pending a full investigation .
" we will suspend those a380 services until we are completely confident that qantas safety requirements have been met , " joyce said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one on board was injured according to joyce one of flight qf32 's four rolls-royce trent 900 engines had failed .
the british engine maker pledged to work with qantas to identify the problem .
airbus said the qantas incident had been " significant " but stressed the a380 was safe to fly on three engines .
" we are not playing down the incident , but it is covered in the certification procedures , " a spokesman for the european consortium said .
terrifying flight the a380 has had technical problems in the past , but thursday 's incident was the airbus superjumbo 's first mid-air emergency .
the double-decker plane carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew developed engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from singapore to sydney .
german passenger ulf waschbusch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane 's left wing soon after take-off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qantas is grounding all a380s pending an investigation " something ruptured the left wing , " waschbusch , a technology company executive based in singapore , told the afp news agency after disembarking .
" it was the scariest thing i have ever seen , " he added .
metal debris including a part bearing the airline 's red and white " flying kangaroo " emblem slammed into industrial and residential areas of the indonesian city of batam , south of singapore .
the plane circled over indonesian territory for nearly two hours , dumping fuel prior to the emergency landing at singapore 's changi airport , waschbusch said .
it landed trailing smoke from a blackened engine and was immediately swarmed by six fire engines spraying liquid on it .
history of technical problems qantas has never had a fatal accident in its 90-year history and there have been no fatal incidents involving a380s , which were launched in 2005 .
but since the a380 's first commercial flight in october 2007 , fuel and computer glitches have grounded several a380s and at least one air france flight was forced to turn around and land in new york after problems with its navigation system in november 2009 .
in april , a qantas a380 's tires were damaged on landing in sydney , showering sparks and scaring passengers .
a total of 37 a380s are now flying commercially with qantas , lufthansa , singapore airlines , emirates and air france-klm .
apart from qantas , no other airlines plan to ground their own superjumbo fleets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.11.2010 exhibition recalls forgotten german settlements in moldova großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlers were driven back to germany under supervision by a nazi commission just where is bessarabia , and what does it have to do with germany ?
an exhibition curated by a berlin historian looks at german communities once based in moldova that got swept away in the chaos of world war ii . they were beckoned by russian tsars in 1813 and driven out in 1940 .
they were farmers , craftsmen , teachers , preachers and adherents of a number of religious traditions : people who fled the arbitrary power of german princes and who sought refuge in southern russia and a fruitful region historically known as bessarabia .
the bessarabia-germans brought along their piety , pragmatism , humility and industriousness .
the villages they established bore names that recalled their homeland : friedensfeld , gnadental , neu-posttal or wittenberg .
the region flourished until the settlers were enveloped by the chaos of world war ii - by hitler 's reign from the west and by stalin 's from the east .
history charged on without them , but now an exhibition is memorializing them .
it has opened in the territory where the bessarabia-germans once lived and which now belongs to moldova and the ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following world war ii , the core of the bessarabia region became moldova remembering the past the national museum in the moldovan capital of chisinau typically houses prehistoric treasures .
but the exhibition titled " a pious and capable people " is now highlighting a different chapter of forgotten history .
bessarabia-german anna dragan attended the opening of the exhibition and was touched by what she saw .
" for 20 years , we 've been waiting for this exhibition .
for my family and me , it 's very important .
the lives of our relatives are on display , " she said .
dragan 's grandfather was deported by stalin to siberia , where he died .
other members of the group were deported to blagoveshchensk in siberia , near the chinese border .
" this exhibition shows what the life of the bessarabia-germans was like .
many people have long since forgotten that communities like these existed at all , " dragan said .
she and her husband , the pastor at chisinau 's lutheran church , still speak german .
dragan hopes to find support for the german courses that she organizes .
" we have plans , but we also have patience , " she noted .
emigration and integration the documents , texts and photos in " a pious and capable people " tell the story of a group 's emigration - a story of both integration and cultural independence .
historian ute schmidt researched their dynamic history , wrote books about it and is now curating the show .
" their story is a blank spot on the map .
it 's not taught in schools and scarcely present elsewhere .
the purpose of this exhibition is to bring bessarabia-germans back into the collective memory , " schmidt said .
the project found many supporters , including the german embassy in chisinau .
bildunterschrift : on the way to work : german settlers in the bessarabia region relations between bessarabia-germans and their neighbors were friendly , although the german communities clung tightly to their religious traditions and generally married only within confessional borders .
nonetheless , bessarabia-germans had much contact with their neighbors and took on some of the traditions of those nearby , including russians , moldavians , ukrainians , rumanians , bulgarians and jews .
the settlers borrowed everything from recipes to foreign words , some of which are still in use today .
changing faces but other traces of the bessarabia-germans are scarce , said ute schmidt , and the villages that were once their settlements have changed drastically .
" for example , a village called sarata -lsb- in southwestern ukraine -rsb- , became a military zone , where ss-20 missiles were stationed during the soviet years .
ordinary citizens were n't allowed entry , and everything was taken over by the military .
the church served as a clubhouse for the officers , " she explained .
today , the remaining descendants of the bessarabia-german settlers are spread out all over the map .
in germany , they have banded together to form an association .
others now live in the usa and still speak a southern german dialect , said the historian .
many continue to feel ties to the country of moldova and its history , explained schmidt , and the association in germany has supported many aid projects in impoverished areas of the former soviet union .
" there have been no demands to return or for reparations .
so the people here are happy when germans visit . "

an exhibition curated by a berlin historian looks at german communities once based in moldova that got swept away in the chaos of world war ii . they were beckoned by russian tsars in 1813 and driven out in 1940 .
they were farmers , craftsmen , teachers , preachers and adherents of a number of religious traditions : people who fled the arbitrary power of german princes and who sought refuge in southern russia and a fruitful region historically known as bessarabia .
the bessarabia-germans brought along their piety , pragmatism , humility and industriousness .
the villages they established bore names that recalled their homeland : friedensfeld , gnadental , neu-posttal or wittenberg .
the region flourished until the settlers were enveloped by the chaos of world war ii - by hitler 's reign from the west and by stalin 's from the east .
history charged on without them , but now an exhibition is memorializing them .
it has opened in the territory where the bessarabia-germans once lived and which now belongs to moldova and the ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following world war ii , the core of the bessarabia region became moldova remembering the past the national museum in the moldovan capital of chisinau typically houses prehistoric treasures .
but the exhibition titled " a pious and capable people " is now highlighting a different chapter of forgotten history .
bessarabia-german anna dragan attended the opening of the exhibition and was touched by what she saw .
" for 20 years , we 've been waiting for this exhibition .
for my family and me , it 's very important .
the lives of our relatives are on display , " she said .
dragan 's grandfather was deported by stalin to siberia , where he died .
other members of the group were deported to blagoveshchensk in siberia , near the chinese border .
" this exhibition shows what the life of the bessarabia-germans was like .
many people have long since forgotten that communities like these existed at all , " dragan said .
she and her husband , the pastor at chisinau 's lutheran church , still speak german .
dragan hopes to find support for the german courses that she organizes .
" we have plans , but we also have patience , " she noted .
emigration and integration the documents , texts and photos in " a pious and capable people " tell the story of a group 's emigration - a story of both integration and cultural independence .
historian ute schmidt researched their dynamic history , wrote books about it and is now curating the show .
" their story is a blank spot on the map .
it 's not taught in schools and scarcely present elsewhere .
the purpose of this exhibition is to bring bessarabia-germans back into the collective memory , " schmidt said .
the project found many supporters , including the german embassy in chisinau .
bildunterschrift : on the way to work : german settlers in the bessarabia region relations between bessarabia-germans and their neighbors were friendly , although the german communities clung tightly to their religious traditions and generally married only within confessional borders .
nonetheless , bessarabia-germans had much contact with their neighbors and took on some of the traditions of those nearby , including russians , moldavians , ukrainians , rumanians , bulgarians and jews .
the settlers borrowed everything from recipes to foreign words , some of which are still in use today .
changing faces but other traces of the bessarabia-germans are scarce , said ute schmidt , and the villages that were once their settlements have changed drastically .
" for example , a village called sarata -lsb- in southwestern ukraine -rsb- , became a military zone , where ss-20 missiles were stationed during the soviet years .
ordinary citizens were n't allowed entry , and everything was taken over by the military .
the church served as a clubhouse for the officers , " she explained .
today , the remaining descendants of the bessarabia-german settlers are spread out all over the map .
in germany , they have banded together to form an association .
others now live in the usa and still speak a southern german dialect , said the historian .
many continue to feel ties to the country of moldova and its history , explained schmidt , and the association in germany has supported many aid projects in impoverished areas of the former soviet union .
" there have been no demands to return or for reparations .
so the people here are happy when germans visit . "

a team in glasgow has brought the century-old science fiction dream a bit nearer to reality . the concept of invisibility has been present in science fiction for well over a century .
one of the earliest examples was in 1933 , when claude rains starred in the film " the invisible man , " who took " monocane " and became undetectable to the human eye .
the film was an adaptation of the famous h.g. wells novel published nearly 40 years earlier , one of the first science fiction stories to describe invisibility .
later in the 20th century , in the world of comics , sue storm of the fantastic four uses her " psionic " powers to throw mysterious fields around herself or other objects , rendering them invisible . more recently , the popular fictional character harry potter also shows off his invisibility cloak .
however , inspired by this fictional inspiration , within the last 15 years , scientists around the world have made significant advances in invisibility research and materials science .
now , researchers at the university of st. andrews in scotland have come up with a new material they call " meta-flex , " which is another step in the process of creating flexible materials that can cloak an object from visible light .
their research was published thursday in the new journal of physics , a production by the institute of physics and the germany physical society .
" in the last ten years there has been a lot of excitement around these new materials which are called metamaterials , " said andrea di falco , the lead researcher on the project , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they could be used in materials that for example could be wrapped around an object to make this object invisible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claude rains took a potion to turn invisible in a 1933 film - it 's done differently today flexible cloaking device on the way those " fields " created by sue storm and the fictional boy wizard actually contain an bit of real science within then , since they are also bending light around themselves to disappear .
scientists today are working with that same principle , according to di falco .
but up to now , the cloaks that have shielded object from some frequencies of light - in the terahertz and near-infrared range - have been realized on rigid surfaces .
di falco 's team has been working on fabricating a flexible material so that " all the physics , all the phenomena that are shown in a rigid and flat geometry will also exist in a flexible one . "
" we are one step closer to the realization of invisibility cloaking that really looks like a piece of cloth instead of something rigid , " he added .
the team developed a complicated technique in which meta-atoms - the constituent part of metamaterials - are freed from the hard substrate they are constructed upon .
di falco and his colleagues say stacking them together could create an independent , flexible material which can be adopted for use in a wide range of applications .
metamaterials are a relatively new class of materials whose properties are based on structure rather than their chemistry - and those properties are ones which may not occur in nature .
they possess a negative refraction index , meaning they can bend electromagnetic waves , including light , around an object .
the metamaterial surface can trick the eye into thinking an object is not there by bending light away as it refracts from the surface .
" metamaterials give us the ultimate handle on manipulating the behavior of light , " di falco said . high hurdles remain but full invisibility is still a ways off on the horizon , if it even comes .
the main obstacle is cloaking all many frequencies in visible light at the same time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real version of harry potter 's invisibility cloak wo n't go on sale any time soon " when dealing with metamaterials , we can not cover a broad band since metamaterial resonance is a narrow band , " said elena semouchkina , an associate professor at michigan state university whose team created a cylindrical cloaking device made of glass , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the fine tuning is the difficult part , especially when it comes to objects of irregular shapes and that pesky full spectrum of visible light .
" right now we are bound to a specific shape of an object and frequencies , " she added .
" different qualities demand different mathematics and material properties , and we are n't quite there yet . "
applications abound the application possibilities of invisibility cloaks are enormous , especially in the military and security areas .
but there are other applications for metamaterials , such as building a " perfect lens " microscope to view particles smaller than the wavelength of light used to view them - something not currently possible .
or , according to di falco , his meta-flex material could be placed on disposable contract lenses , creating superlenses for visual prostheses .
on the battlefield , metamaterials in the creation of a new lens could allow soldiers to be able to see pathogens and viruses that are currently impossible to detect with any visual device .
" research is moving pretty fast actually and definitely in a couple of decades , a few applications that really work will appear , i 'm sure , " said semouchkina .

tadic apologized for the deaths of more than 200 croats at the hands of serbs in 1991 . serbian president boris tadic on thursday apologized for the 1991 vukovar massacre , in which around 200 croats were killed , as he paid an historic visit to the town . " i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am here to pay respect to the victims and to express words of apology and regret , " tadic said in a statement at the ovcara memorial before laying a wreath that read " to the innocent victims . " " i am here to create the possibility for croatia and serbia to turn a page so that our children will not be burdened by the history of the 1990s , " tadic added . historic reconciliation in 1991 the mainly serb yugoslav national army and serb paramilitary forces bombarded the town of vukovar , leveling it , leaving scores of croats dead and forcing many others to flee .
in november of that year , after seizing vukovar , more than 200 croats were marched out of the town 's hospital .
they were then killed and buried in a mass grave at the ovcara pig farm . the massacre marked the beginning of a four-year war that claimed some 20,000 lives in croatia , and remains a painful symbol for croats of serb wartime brutality . tadic and croatian president josipovic on thursday laid wreaths at the mass grave in the clearest message yet of condemnation of all wartime crimes and the need for reconciliation between the two peoples after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic apologized for the killing of 200 croats local media have described the serbian president 's visit to the croat town as " historic . "
tadic is the first serbian leader to make such a visit to croatia . apology refused by some despite the conciliatory gesture , tadic 's visit drew criticism from the serbian opposition , which called it a " marketing move . "
several protesters gathered on the road to the ovcara monument with signs reading , " you can not wash away our blood " and " apologies but no regrets . " the two presidents were later to visit the nearby town of paulin dvor to honor 18 serbs killed there by croats during the 1991-95 war . tadic was also expected to meet with croatian prime minister jadranka kosor . author : natalia dannenberg , david levitz -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.11.2010 us political shift : the effects on the wider world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shift of power means some shift of policy is certain the debate ahead of us midterm elections was dominated by domestic affairs , but that did n't stop the wider world from taking a keen interest .
indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
" they support israel and see it as part of the war on terror . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soild movement on climate change appears unlikely obama is also on a collision course with the republicans on this .
however , this time he will not be able to make to make political capital unless a change comes about from within the region itself .
experts are agreed that the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility will still be pursued by the government , but that it no longer has any priority .
it has disappeared from the agenda for public debate and , even among democrats , is controversial .
no way ahead on climate change the chances of comprehensive climate change legislation are now almost completely non-existent .
the president himself admitted as much on the day after the elections .
" there are a lot of republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the house last year , " obama said .
" and so it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year or next year or the year after . "
it was the first time in the one-hour press conference that obama raised a subject that was of significance abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republicans are likely to press for tougher sanctions over the iran nuclear dispute with regard to the nuclear dispute with iran , dueck expects that the republicans will push obama to increase pressure on the iranian administration and to adopt new , stricter sanctions - possibly on a unilateral basis .
the conservative wing of the republican party believes in particular that president obama is weak on national security policy , said dueck , who expects they will put him under pressure on a range of issues .
good cop , bad cop ?
in international negotiations , obama could use this to his advantage and play an international role of " good cop , bad cop , " dueck says .
he could argue that , while he might personally be ready to make concessions on the global stage , he would also have to consider the views of congress in washington .
this could provide obama with greater international influence according to dueck .
whether he does choose to act this way or not , of course , remains to be seen .

they may be well-qualified , but they often earn less than 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,400 dollars -rrb- a month . after years of working long hours for low pay , an estimated 3,500 czech doctors are threatening to quit by the end of the year and join an exodus to western europe .
many earn less than skilled carpenters or plumbers , and face government austerity measures that will cut health care funds even further . neighboring germany , where a recent study by the hospital institute estimated that there was a shortfall of 5,500 doctors , is interested in recruiting disgruntled czech medics .
representatives from some 30 german clinics visited prague at the end of october , with the aim of filling more than 100 vacancies back in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs over 5,000 more doctors lucie and evzen gorbunov were among those at the german jobs fair in prague .
lucie is a 28-year-old anesthetist ; her husband evzen is a surgeon .
they 've had enough of the conditions in czech health care . " i finished my medical degree two years ago , " lucie gorbunov said .
" the working conditions are really bad : lots of night shifts , not enough pay .
if i work an extra six to seven nights in a month i get around 25,000 crowns net , which works out at roughly 1,000 euros a month . " most young czech doctors have to do extra shifts or take a second job just to keep their heads above water .
according to evzen gorbunov , low wages are only part of the problem : " as a young doctor i 'm in a difficult position , " he said .
" it 's very hard to progress here .
in the first year we 're often kept busy with bureaucracy , forms and calculations , and we have little contact with patients .
young surgeons are only allowed to observe operations and pass instruments to the head surgeon in the first few years . " ' thanks , we 're leaving ' that 's why thousands of czech doctors have launched an initiative called " thanks , we 're leaving . "
they 're demanding monthly wages be increased to between 1,500 and 3,000 euros .
in the meantime , many , like the gorbunovs , are determined to try their luck abroad .
in countries like germany new graduates can earn up to five times the equivalent czech salaries , with shorter working hours . " i did an internship in germany as a student and i enjoyed it , " lucie gorbunov said .
" especially the opportunity for further training .
in general i liked the more relaxed atmosphere among doctors and the financial rewards . " roswitha wiedemann from the east allgaeu-kaufbeuren clinic in southern germany is looking for people like the gorbunovs .
her hospital currently has seven vacancies for junior doctors .
she 's hoping the czech republic can provide back-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech medical students are well-trained " we 're pleasantly surprised the interest is so high , " wiedemann said at the jobs fair in prague .

" we really like it , so we 're going to send off our applications and see what happens . " loss of young talent if they do emigrate to germany , there are concerns the czech health care system may struggle without them .
patient representatives in the czech republic say even if 500 leave it will put pressure on an already strained system .
but the czech health ministry has said it does not expect all the doctors to make good on their pledge to leave , and that the health care sector wo n't suffer if they do . wiedemann said concerns over a mass exodus of doctors should not be over exaggerated , and that there is a positive side . " the young doctors who are coming to us at the moment will return to the czech republic full of experience , " she said .

now the world 's biggest bank by assets , it has adopted a confident swagger , despite the recent crisis . bnp paribas reported on thursday a 46-percent rise in profits for the third quarter and said it would not have to raise more capital to meet new banking standards .
it is another round of good news for a bank which has 34.47 percent in the past three years , becoming the world 's biggest when measured by assets . the paris-based bank has assets of 2.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.21 trillion -rrb- . but as the banking behemoth promises a positive end to this year , some question if it is wise to allow banks to become big enough to put entire sectors , or even economies , at risk should they fail .
that was the fear in the united states in the recent financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system there and led to new banking regulation signed into law this year . but the french appear to be taking a somewhat more laissez-faire attitude , despite concerns about continued risks to financial stability related to europe 's sovereign debt crisis . " i think the french are nervous about it , but they are ignoring the possible problems , " manfred jaeger-ambrozewicz , a banking expert at the cologne institute for business research , told deutsche welle . size does n't matter for now , bnp is smiling and the french government does n't appear eager to step in to break up the bank or impose new regulations , as some other countries are . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is toughening up capital requirements for its banks substantially switzerland is introducing new rules that will curb risks from its biggest banks , calling for substantially higher capital requirements than international rules require . even britain , which has traditionally been hands-off regarding its banks , is examining whether some of its biggest financial institutions should be broken up .
in the us , the new dodd-frank act prohibits banks from trading from their own account . but french bankers have dismissed concerns about size . " size is n't limited to risk , " frederic oudea , the ceo of societe generale , told a parliamentary hearing .

non merci french bankers have also balked at new rules on capital . " asking for more capital is not necessarily more virtuous if it 's simply a counterparty to more risk , " bank of france governor christian noyer said in mid-october .
" if banks in some countries have very risky profiles and regulators ask them to hold more capital , it 's their problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ' prot is one of the few french bank heads to have kept his job through the crisis new banking rules by the basel committee on banking supervision will gradually require banks to hold greater capital buffers to absorb potential losses . called basel iii for short , the new regulations will force banks to hold top-quality capital totaling 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets , more than triple what they do now .
lenders have until 2019 to implement some of the rules . on thursday , as bnp paribas reported its big profits , it also ruled out a capital increase to meet the new industry rules , saying its own revenue generation would allow it to comply with the basel iii requirements . " no capital increase whatsoever , " bnp chief executive baudouin prot told reuters .
" i 'm very confident on the capital position . " several banks across europe have gone to investors for fresh equity as the tighter capital requirements loom . national champions france has a tradition of government involvement in the private sector .
since the 1960s , paris has intervened to save the so-called " national champions , " companies seen as essential to the national economy or the country 's global reputation , and which paris sees as too important to fail . in 2004 , french president nicolas sarkozy led a state bailout of alstrom when he was finance minister and encouraged the nation 's two biggest drug makers to merge in order to put off a bid from swiss competitor novartis . the gallic crowing around banks these days could have to do with protecting prestigious french companies , according to jaeger-ambrozewicz . " i can imagine that the french do n't want to break up this bank , " he said .
" they are saying , ' this is our national champion , the number one in the world by assets . " ' if it 's going well , paris might think the best intervention is no intervention , according to nicolas veron of the brussels-based think tank bruegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hinted it would intervene in the case of societe general back in 2008 but that does n't mean the french government has adopted a policy of allowing the market to operate freely in every case .
he pointed to societe generale 's problems in 2008 when it lost 5 billion euros due to a " rogue " trader .
during the crisis , the french prime minister insisted that no matter what , the bank would remain french . " i would argue that economic nationalism is at least as strong in the banking sector in france as in other sectors , " veron told deutsche welle . doing well french banks in general , and bnp paribas in particular , weathered the financial crisis better than their rivals in other countries .
banking assets in france rose 41 percent between 2005 and 2009 , to 7.16 trillion euros , according to the european central bank .
that is almost four times france 's gdp . " -lrb- bnp paris -rrb- is one of those banks which emerged from the crisis as a winner , as things currently stand .
it certainly strengthened its european market share and did n't take any visible big hits , " veron said . the four biggest french banks - bnp paribas , credit agricole , societe generale and groupe bpce - all passed eu stress tests in july .
the inquiries looked at whether banks had enough capital to outlast an economic slowdown and sovereign debt crisis , although some analysts argued the tests were not rigorous enough . that makes analysts like jaeger-ambrozewicz slightly worried .
he said he fears that banks , both in france and in europe as a whole , might be overconfident and not have learned from the crisis . " banks now look healthier than they really are .
the problem of systemic risk has not really been addressed yet , " he said .

now the world 's biggest bank by assets , it has adopted a confident swagger , despite the recent crisis . bnp paribas reported on thursday a 46-percent rise in profits for the third quarter and said it would not have to raise more capital to meet new banking standards .
it is another round of good news for a bank which has 34.47 percent in the past three years , becoming the world 's biggest when measured by assets . the paris-based bank has assets of 2.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.21 trillion -rrb- . but as the banking behemoth promises a positive end to this year , some question if it is wise to allow banks to become big enough to put entire sectors , or even economies , at risk should they fail .
that was the fear in the united states in the recent financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system there and led to new banking regulation signed into law this year . but the french appear to be taking a somewhat more laissez-faire attitude , despite concerns about continued risks to financial stability related to europe 's sovereign debt crisis . " i think the french are nervous about it , but they are ignoring the possible problems , " manfred jaeger-ambrozewicz , a banking expert at the cologne institute for business research , told deutsche welle . size does n't matter for now , bnp is smiling and the french government does n't appear eager to step in to break up the bank or impose new regulations , as some other countries are . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland is toughening up capital requirements for its banks substantially switzerland is introducing new rules that will curb risks from its biggest banks , calling for substantially higher capital requirements than international rules require . even britain , which has traditionally been hands-off regarding its banks , is examining whether some of its biggest financial institutions should be broken up .
in the us , the new dodd-frank act prohibits banks from trading from their own account . but french bankers have dismissed concerns about size . " size is n't limited to risk , " frederic oudea , the ceo of societe generale , told a parliamentary hearing .
socgen is france 's third-biggest bank by assets . new capital ?
non merci french bankers have also balked at new rules on capital . " asking for more capital is not necessarily more virtuous if it 's simply a counterparty to more risk , " bank of france governor christian noyer said in mid-october .
" if banks in some countries have very risky profiles and regulators ask them to hold more capital , it 's their problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ' prot is one of the few french bank heads to have kept his job through the crisis new banking rules by the basel committee on banking supervision will gradually require banks to hold greater capital buffers to absorb potential losses . called basel iii for short , the new regulations will force banks to hold top-quality capital totaling 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets , more than triple what they do now .
lenders have until 2019 to implement some of the rules . on thursday , as bnp paribas reported its big profits , it also ruled out a capital increase to meet the new industry rules , saying its own revenue generation would allow it to comply with the basel iii requirements . " no capital increase whatsoever , " bnp chief executive baudouin prot told reuters .
" i 'm very confident on the capital position . " several banks across europe have gone to investors for fresh equity as the tighter capital requirements loom . national champions france has a tradition of government involvement in the private sector .
since the 1960s , paris has intervened to save the so-called " national champions , " companies seen as essential to the national economy or the country 's global reputation , and which paris sees as too important to fail . in 2004 , french president nicolas sarkozy led a state bailout of alstrom when he was finance minister and encouraged the nation 's two biggest drug makers to merge in order to put off a bid from swiss competitor novartis . the gallic crowing around banks these days could have to do with protecting prestigious french companies , according to jaeger-ambrozewicz . " i can imagine that the french do n't want to break up this bank , " he said .
" they are saying , ' this is our national champion , the number one in the world by assets . " ' if it 's going well , paris might think the best intervention is no intervention , according to nicolas veron of the brussels-based think tank bruegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hinted it would intervene in the case of societe general back in 2008 but that does n't mean the french government has adopted a policy of allowing the market to operate freely in every case .
he pointed to societe generale 's problems in 2008 when it lost 5 billion euros due to a " rogue " trader .

after starting slowly in what turned out to be a fantastic campaign last season , how could louis van gaal justify taking just as long to get going in this campaign with the same team he led to the german league and cup double as well as the champions league final ?

they were just a one-man-band who were ordinary without arjen robben .
imagine how silly we feel now .
european stroll bayern munich have qualified for the next round of the champions league with a 100 percent record and two games to spare .
and they did so on wednesday night in some style .
bayern 's fourth win out of four in the champions league this season , coming away from home against romanian champions cfr cluj , extended their excellent start in the competition and showed a cutting edge and fluidity that had been missing from most of their bundesliga performances this season .
while bayern 's european form has been consistent and efficient , their bundesliga performances have - until recently - been more disappointing .
things now look to be falling into place for bayern in the league as it has done across europe , even if the club 's president uli hoeness remains far from happy with van gaal 's methods .
the club are still some ten points off the bundesliga summit but with just over two months of the campaign gone , bayern appear to be gaining a similar momentum to that which saw them eat up ground on their rivals in last season 's title race and pushed them towards the european cup final in madrid .
it was november before their bundesliga season came to life and they were in danger of crashing out of the champions league group stages before christmas .
back-to-back wins against freiburg in the bundesliga and cluj in the champions league suggest that van gaal has finally worked out what has been going wrong with his team in recent weeks .
hoeness , however , claims to have known all along - that fringe players he believes have more of a role to play in the first team should be given their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting on the scoresheet against freiburg did demichelis good van gaal certainly saw the benefits of using players like mario gomez , anatoliy tymoschuk and martin demichelis in last week 's 4-2 win over freiburg - all three got on the score sheet .
hoeness maintains that the dutchman would have sold these men given half the chance , thereby denying bayern valuable manpower .
against cluj , gomez in particular showed again that bayern do have strength in depth - when van gaal chooses to use it .
denied the opportunity of using ivica olic and miroslav klose due to injuries , van gaal was forced more out of circumstance than choice to throw gomez , the 30 million-euro bench warmer , into the fray .
luckily for van gaal , the former stuttgart man finally showed some of the form which persuaded bayern to pay such a fee last year .
because … or in spite of ?
it could be argued then that van gaal has played his hand perfectly , if a little late .
he has watched his first choice team struggle against the likes of kaiserslautern and cologne , and has now turned to his alternatives who have been champing at the bit to perform .
by denying them their chance , he has been building their desire - a desire evident in their displays since being recalled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is not known as a man who likes owning up to mistakes on the other hand , the gruff dutchman may have just run out of ideas and , desperate for any kind of turnaround , has thrown his misfits into the mix .
it is unlikely van gaal will admit to this , especially with the equally formidable hoeness watching for any more perceived signs of weakness , both in tactical ability and character .
wednesday 's result , on the back of last friday 's mauling of freiburg , and a predicted rout at home to woeful basement club borussia moenchengladbach on saturday , will certainly ease whatever fears remain over bayern 's current direction .
as long as they continue in an upward trajectory , the team 's critics - both external and internal - will have less ammunition to aim at the bayern players and , more prominently , their coach .

" the economy is improving , the new prognoses are surprisingly good , and i think in light of this development there ca n't be any holdup in tax policy , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fahrenschon called for a debate on tax reform by 2011 " i also think it 's false to view the interplay between economic development and tax and financial policy as one-dimensional , " fahrenschon said .

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted . " but it 's doubtable if that would be a feature social networks would actually welcome , " hoeren added .
" what happens if you forget about the deadline you set and half of your page has been raided ? " the new rules will form the basis for an overhaul of the eu 's laws on data protection scheduled for next year . the approach comes at a time when britain ruled google had breached uk law by harvesting emails , internet addresses and passwords while collecting data for its street view mapping service .

the european commission wants to strengthen people 's ' right to be forgotten . ' the european union announced on thursday its intention to give individuals more control on how their personal data is collected and used . " the protection of personal data is a fundamental right , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said in a statement . ' right to be forgotten ' this also includes the " right to be forgotten , " when people decide to permanently remove their data from the internet , for instance when deleting photos and other information from social networking sites . individuals should be informed in a transparent way on how , why , by whom , and for how long their data is collected and used . " people should be able to give their informed consent to the processing of their personal data , " she added . companies make use of search histories the new data-protection strategy could affect the business practices of social networks such as facebook and search engines like google .
in order to specifically target online advertising , internet companies make use of an individual 's search history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner vivane reding called for the " right to be forgotten " " the political approach is heading in the right direction , and maybe it can help to raise awareness in the general public , " said thomas hoeren , a professor at the institute for information , telecommunication and media law at the university of muenster , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but legal enforcement wo n't work for international providers such as facebook . " given the fact that these american companies do n't have to abide by european law , the restrictions might only work if there is indirect pressure . " if some of the social networks have to abide by stricter rules , it could create a form of competition among the sites , " hoeren said .
" this could put pressure on facebook to comply as well . " european officials noted that while the new rules may not be completely effective , that an attempt was necessary . " it 's worthwhile giving this a try , " said thomas zerdick , a legal officer and data protection expert at the european commission , in an interview with deutsche welle . automatic deadline on online content there also have been ongoing discussions about putting a deadline on photos and posts - the idea is that the user could then select when items should be automatically deleted . " but it 's doubtable if that would be a feature social networks would actually welcome , " hoeren added .
" what happens if you forget about the deadline you set and half of your page has been raided ? " the new rules will form the basis for an overhaul of the eu 's laws on data protection scheduled for next year . the approach comes at a time when britain ruled google had breached uk law by harvesting emails , internet addresses and passwords while collecting data for its street view mapping service .
germany , spain , france , italy and canada are also continuing their investigations . author : sarah steffen -lrb- ap , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , the changes in washington look sure to have a global impact . the campaign running up to the us congressional elections was dominated by domestic matters , in particular the economy .
nevertheless , the loss of the house of representatives for the democrats is also sure to have an effect on the country ’ s foreign policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette heuser says the first fault lines are likely to appear over the start treaty the most important foreign policy decision to be taken in the wake of the midterm us congressional elections is the ratification of the start nuclear disarmament treaty with russia .
short of senate votes even before the democrats registered their losses in the elections , start ratification had not been looking easy with the democrats falling short of the 67 votes they needed in the senate .
now it looks distinctly more difficult , said annette heuser , director of the bertelsmann foundation in washington .
" it is expected that the republicans will take the opportunity to use the start treaty as a strategic tool to embarrass the president on foreign policy as well as domestic policy - but also to prove that he has compromised too quickly with the russians . "
the criticism of republicans , and also of some democrats , is that the treaty was negotiated too quickly and that it does not sufficiently take into account american interests such as missile defense and the ability to modernize its own nuclear arsenal .
" obama has two possibilities , " said heuser .
" he can buy agreement to the start treaty with compromises in other areas of policy , or implement it without ratification .
however , that would require an agreement with the russians . "
political capital from afghanistan in contrast , the president is not dependent on the agreement of congress when it comes to afghanistan policy .
if he decides , as planned , to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011 , then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army .
this could possibly earn him points with the public , said stephen f. szabo , who is director of the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund in washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szabo claims the us public is weary with afghanistan " the republicans are against an early withdrawal from afghanistan , " szabo said .
" they would fight against it and would have the military on their side . "
obama might then garner support , according to szabo - the american public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in iraq and afghanistan .
for other economic blocs , such as the european union , the strengthening of the republicans could have a positive effect , claimed szabo ; at least where free trade is concerned .
" it means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years , " he said .
middle east outlook bleak on the matter of the middle east peace process , problems were evident even before the election defeats , said colin dueck , politics professor at the george mason university in fairfax , virginia .
dueck , the author of a book about republican foreign policy , said that president obama has tried to put the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu under pressure , without success .
the result has been a stalemate and lack of confidence in the peace process .
" the view of most republicans is quite simple , " said dueck .
