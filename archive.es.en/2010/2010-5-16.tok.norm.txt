its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .

juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .

among the spectators was bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who asked " am i dressed warmly enough ? " after exiting his car upon his arrival in oberammergau .
he joined a bundled up crowd in taking in the performance on the opening night on saturday .
the 41st edition of the play is being directed for the third time by christian stueckel .
he made his debut as the play 's director for the first time in 1990 as a 28-year-old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 16.05.2010 already on top , bayern munich are unlikely to mess much with perfection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern could have years of celebrations ahead of them as the season draws to a close , most teams are plotting how to do things better next year .
bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .
buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for more regulation in her speech defending the trillion-dollar -lrb- € 750 billion -rrb- stabilization package for the common european currency , agreed to by the eurozone economies and the international monetary fund last week , the chancellor still said that far more was needed .
" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .
papandreou said they bore " great responsibility " for greece 's debt crisis .
in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .
the greek parliament is currently looking into deals the government made in 2000 with help from goldman sachs to allow them to mask the extent of greece 's debts using complex financial accounting practices. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "

two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "

the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 16.05.2010 already on top , bayern munich are unlikely to mess much with perfection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern could have years of celebrations ahead of them as the season draws to a close , most teams are plotting how to do things better next year .
bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 16.05.2010 already on top , bayern munich are unlikely to mess much with perfection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern could have years of celebrations ahead of them as the season draws to a close , most teams are plotting how to do things better next year .
bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the play depicting the life and crucifixion of jesus christ is actually a centuries old tradition in the bavarian town .
legend has it that in 1633 , the residents of oberammergau promised god that if they were spared from the bubonic plague , they would stage the passion play every 10 years .
so far , the plague has stayed away , but the actors and spectators in the open-air theater where the play is performed have not been spared from the elements .
temperatures for the opening weekend were around 5 degrees celsius -lrb- 41 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : the open-air performance draws thousands .
the chance to witness the spectacle only comes once every 10 years - since the 17th century chilly debut despite the gloomy weather , 4,700 spectators were on hand to take in the five-hour play , which features about half of oberammergau 's roughly 5,000 citizens .
among the spectators was bavarian state premier horst seehofer , who asked " am i dressed warmly enough ? " after exiting his car upon his arrival in oberammergau .
he joined a bundled up crowd in taking in the performance on the opening night on saturday .
the 41st edition of the play is being directed for the third time by christian stueckel .
he made his debut as the play 's director for the first time in 1990 as a 28-year-old .
like all of the play 's participants , stueckel was also born and raised in oberammergau - one of the conditions of being allowed to take part .
exceptions are made to people who have moved into the town and lived there for 20 years .
the play 's long history in oberammergau has turned it into a popular destination for tourists from all over the world .

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .
buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for more regulation in her speech defending the trillion-dollar -lrb- € 750 billion -rrb- stabilization package for the common european currency , agreed to by the eurozone economies and the international monetary fund last week , the chancellor still said that far more was needed .
" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .
papandreou said they bore " great responsibility " for greece 's debt crisis .
in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .
the greek parliament is currently looking into deals the government made in 2000 with help from goldman sachs to allow them to mask the extent of greece 's debts using complex financial accounting practices. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .

he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .

youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?

securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .

this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .
buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for more regulation in her speech defending the trillion-dollar -lrb- € 750 billion -rrb- stabilization package for the common european currency , agreed to by the eurozone economies and the international monetary fund last week , the chancellor still said that far more was needed .
" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .
papandreou said they bore " great responsibility " for greece 's debt crisis .
in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .
the greek parliament is currently looking into deals the government made in 2000 with help from goldman sachs to allow them to mask the extent of greece 's debts using complex financial accounting practices. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .
the people at bayern munich , however , say that when you get to the top the only thing to do when you get there is to stay there .
no-one can guarantee anything in life and sport is no exception .
bayern munich may finish this season by re-writing the history books regarding german soccer , ending the campaign as german league and cup winners with a european cup thrown in for good measure .
there is a reason why this haul is called unprecedented – because no-one has done it before .
it 's that hard to do .
in the infinite realm of possibilities of course , bayern could complete their treble this season and retain all three titles next season too .
this realm , however , also contains the possibility that louis van gaal runs a guest house on mars in another dimension , has five heads and goes by the name of zwarg .
bayern winning a second consecutive treble is indeed more likely , but only just .
still , one can bet the farm -lrb- or the guest house on mars -rrb- that the bayern hierarchy is going to do all it physically and financially can to give their team the best possible shot at playing for a second treble next season .
why go to all the trouble of winning all that silverware if you 're not going to bother defending it ?
securing van gaal for years would be a masterstroke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern should retain the services of the dutch master bayern coach louis van gaal has proved that he has the knowledge , the strategy and the attitude to turn bayern munich from a listing ship into an unsinkable destroyer .
his remodeling of this bayern team - not only into an attacking force filled with flair and quality but also into a force as fearsome as the bayern teams of old - has been the story of this season in many quarters .
as such , it is unlikely that the bayern munich hierarchy will want to dispose of his services or let others lure him away .
van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .

van gaal is an integral part of bayern 's future success and they stand a better chance of competing at the business end of all competitions with him at the helm .
securing the coach on a longer contract , chaining him to the dug out and hanging a rock of kryptonite round his neck should be the first actions of the munich management this summer .
in reality there is little chance of van gaal going elsewhere or demanding to be released from his golden cage .
if bayern are german and european champions at the end of this season , where could he go where he could enjoy as much success ?
real madrid ?
as an ex-barcelona coach , it 's unlikely he 'd even entertain the idea .
manchester united ?
it 's unlikely he 'd want to swap a solid club for one mired in debt and ownership problems .
van gaal will stay … unless the bayern project no longer presents a challenge for him .
there are no guarantees , remember ?
spending with intelligence the secret to continuity in a bid to turn these champions into a team which can dominate germany and champions league for years to come , van gaal is going to have to be allowed to spend .
it 's unlikely that bayern will refuse him a couple of tactical purchases to shore up a team which already has a solid basis , a good spirit and enough star quality to entertain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben proved that strategic signings can work spending recklessly on trophy signings has been the downfall of many a club , but neither bayern 's management nor its coach seem to be wired that way .
the purchase of arjen robben looked risky at the time , but he filled a very specific role in van gaal 's formation - so ably , in fact , that it played a big part in turning bayern into champions .
bayern have a good mix of youth and experience at the moment , with thomas mueller and holger badstuber proving that the future is bright .
who knows what other gems may be lurking in the reserves and youth teams , ready to be unearthed by a gruff dutchman with a set of gardening tools ?
youngsters diego contento and david alaba , for example , did n't quite make the impression that badstuber or mueller did - but did show signs that they may be ready break-out years next season .
in the meantime , bayern could do with some strengthening if they are to keep ahead of the domestic and european packs .
all areas in need of fresh faces joerg butt 's time as first choice keeper at bayern may soon end despite what has possibly been his best-ever season .
bayern 's former french contingent willy sagnol and bixente lizarazu have been publicly urging the club to make a move for lyon and france goalkeeper hugo lloris .
meanwhile , others are calling the world cup a bayern audition for sergio romero , argentina 's number one who played for van gaal back in holland at az alkmaar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edin dzeko is a proven bundesliga goal scorer up front , miroslav klose 's playing time has dwindled down to bit player status and mario gomez has lost his place as well .
bayern 's attack now rests on the slim shoulders of thomas mueller and stubby shape of ivica olic , meaning bayern should probably get themselves one more quality striker in the close season .
wolfsburg 's edin dzeko would be a natural choice - were it not for his 40 million euro price tag , and the fact that he seems to have his heart set on joining ac milan .
in midfield , anatoliy tymoschchuk and hamit altintop should be allowed to graze on pastures new while bayern might cut their losses on franck ribery and use the money from his possible sale to snap up manchester united 's park ji-sung . the korean would provide much less creativity on the wing than ribery - but just as much energy , and would cost so much less that bayern would be likely to put much of what was left over toward another player .
some have mooted moves for big-name players like barcelona 's yaya toure or lassana diarra of real madrid , but doing so might cause unnecessary discord .
bayern 's current central midfield pairing of mark van bommel and bastian schweinsteiger is bringing the goods at present , and a younger player who would not mind making way for them -lrb- marseilles ' stephane m 'bia 's name has come up -rrb- could be a more prudent option .
building a new defense could be prudent bildunterschrift : holger badstuber is bayern 's center back of the future in defence , bayern certainly need some cover .
while martin demichelis and daniel van byuten have finally grown into a quality central pairing , younger alternatives should be sought to maintain continuity as injuries and age begin to wear them down .
with badstuber showing composure in his stints at center-back -lrb- and with breno coming back from a successful , if injury-marred stint at nuremburg -rrb- , buying another man for the middle is not likely to be a high priority .
cover on the outside is more urgent .
philipp lahm has already shown he can play effectively on either wing , and badstuber can play wide in a pinch , but beyond that the pickings are slim at bayern .
the untested contento has begun to string together some games at left back and comported himself well , but bayern might be tempted to shoot for the stars and lure a world-class offensive full back .
a player like barcelona 's dani alves or maicon of their champions league final opponents inter milan would make bayern 's wing-based attack an even trickier proposition trickier still , however , would be attracting them to the bundesliga .
the players needed to keep bayern at the top may want more than the chance to play for the current german and european champions .
despite its best efforts , the bundesliga is still seen as a poor relation to other leagues , though this perception is slowly changing .
bayern and the champions league may have their own allure but convincing players to play week-in , week-out in germany is another matter .
but then stranger things have happened , like bayern winning the treble – twice -lrb- possibly -rrb- .

bayern munich , already on the verge of a historic treble , are just looking to stay on top of the german and european game . some people say that when you reach the top , the only way you can go from there is down .

it 's that hard to do .

ten months ago , on july 1 , reiss was arrested in tehran during demonstrations against iran 's newly elected president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
she was charged a month later for allegedly undermining national security and sentenced to 10 years in jail .
she was released on bail to the french embassy in tehran , where she has been staying under house arrest .

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .
buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for more regulation in her speech defending the trillion-dollar -lrb- € 750 billion -rrb- stabilization package for the common european currency , agreed to by the eurozone economies and the international monetary fund last week , the chancellor still said that far more was needed .
" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .
papandreou said they bore " great responsibility " for greece 's debt crisis .
in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .

according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 16.05.2010 berlin eyes back door for passing nuclear power extension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plants are set to be shut down by 2022 - for now losses in state elections left germany 's coalition without a majority in the upper house of parliament and cast doubt on plans to extend operation of nuclear plants .
now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .
buying time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for more regulation in her speech defending the trillion-dollar -lrb- € 750 billion -rrb- stabilization package for the common european currency , agreed to by the eurozone economies and the international monetary fund last week , the chancellor still said that far more was needed .
" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .
papandreou said they bore " great responsibility " for greece 's debt crisis .
in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .
the greek parliament is currently looking into deals the government made in 2000 with help from goldman sachs to allow them to mask the extent of greece 's debts using complex financial accounting practices. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.05.2010 underground skyscraper serves as fifa 's unique headquarters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's no big surprise that there is a soccer field outside fifa 's headquarters the fifa headquarters in zurich are a secretive spot in which the future of soccer is decided .
its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

but she said the european union could only overcome the problem by coming to terms with the big differences which exist between europe 's strongest and weakest economies .
" this calls for more regulation , " merkel said in a speech , trying to calm labor union concerns , " but unfortunately this speculation was , and is , only possible because there are considerable differences in economic strength and indebtedness between the member states of the euro . "
the euro tumbled more than four percent against the dollar on friday to an 18-month low of just over $ 1.23 .

" we have done no more than buy time for ourselves to clear up the differences in competitiveness and in budget deficits of individual eurozone countries , " merkel said .
" if we simply ignore the problem we will not be able to calm this situation down , " she stressed .
merkel also called for more regulation of the highly speculative derivatives trade , short selling and hedge funds , but added that the excesses of the financial markets could not be combated if the united states did not regulate its own markets .
the chancellor told the berlin meeting that a financial transaction tax proposed by german labor leaders had little chance of success unless it was adopted internationally .
us banks bear ' great responsibility ' meanwhile , in an apparent effort to hold financiers accountable for the global economic crisis , greek prime minister george papandreou on sunday raised the specter of taking legal action against us investment banks .

in terms of culpability , however , the greek government shares a healthy portion of the blame .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .

he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .

it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 16.05.2010 berlin eyes back door for passing nuclear power extension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plants are set to be shut down by 2022 - for now losses in state elections left germany 's coalition without a majority in the upper house of parliament and cast doubt on plans to extend operation of nuclear plants .
now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .
whether or not the government is able to surpass the bundesrat and still get the measure approved depends on the wording and the details of the final proposal , which is set to be presented later this year. mz / afp / apn / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 16.05.2010 berlin eyes back door for passing nuclear power extension großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plants are set to be shut down by 2022 - for now losses in state elections left germany 's coalition without a majority in the upper house of parliament and cast doubt on plans to extend operation of nuclear plants .
now , they hope to bypass the upper house entirely . since national elections last fall , the coalition government in berlin has been indicating its intention to extend the deadline to shut down all of germany 's nuclear power plants .
according to a law passed in 2002 by then-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government , all of germany 's nuclear plants should be switched off by 2022 , but the current government wants to push back this cut-off date , possibly by decades .
after recent regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the coalition 's plans seemed to hit a snag .
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and her partners in the national government , the free democrats , lost their majority in the bundesrat , the german government 's upper house of parliament that represents germany 's 16 states .
it was thought that any extension of the lifespan of germany 's nuclear plants would require the approval of the bundesrat , but now , ronald pofalla , merkel 's chief of staff , has announced berlin 's intention to bypass the bundesrat entirely .
" at the time , chancellor schroeder also passed the law limiting the lifespan of the plants without the bundesrat , " pofalla said in an interview with the waz media group .
not so fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision to extend the lifespan of the nuclear plants is on standby despite the governments plans to circumvent the bundesrat , opposition politicians in berlin are saying " not so fast . "
juergen trittin , current head of the green party parliamentary faction , was the environment minister under schroeder when the original law was passed .
he 's accusing the government of using legal loopholes to get what it wants .
" an extension of the lifespan would put more strain on the states and requires the approval of the bundesrat , " trittin said .
" the government needs to finally realize : there is no majority of support among the public or in the bundesrat for more nuclear waste and a higher risk because of aging reactors . "
carrying forth with a law to extend the life of nuclear reactors without the approval of the bundesrat would go against previous statements made by the current environment minister , norbert roettgen .
roettgen is a member of merkel 's christian democrats , and as recently as february , he said the approval of the bundesrat for such a measure was not only required but also politically recommended .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .

its simple exterior design conceals a rich interior where form is well attuned to function . the unusual new headquarters for the international association of association football -lrb- fifa -rrb- now stands in one of zurich 's most exclusive neighborhoods .
for around 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- , fifa 's 208 member countries chipped in to develop a " skyscraper " that is largely underground .
building was completed three years ago , well in time for the 2010 world cup in june .
the unique building unfolds along 134 meters -lrb- 440 feet -rrb- in a series of sleek , glassy partitions .
but not everyone occupying its offices has made peace with the design by swiss architect tilla theus , in which understatement trumps grandeur , at least on the surface .
" the house we were in before was much prettier , of course , " said fifa president joseph blatter .
" there , i had a view of the lake , but on the other hand , we 're not out to look impressive . "
bildunterschrift : expensive materials were used throughout fifa 's interior more than meets the eye once inside the building , visitors can see that it 's comprised of multiple stories .
two thirds of the headquarters lie underground and include space for archives , parking , meetings , technology and a prayer room .
the segment above ground houses offices for 300 employees , the reception area and a conference room .
although the building 's simple exterior blends in with the woody landscape , the interior is marked by rich material luxury .
its design features costly works from glass , brazilian shale , and american walnut wood .
the aluminium walls in the headquarters were hammered from a specially constructed machine and are adorned with chrome steel hand railings that artfully reflect the light streaming inside .
modesty was clearly not at the fore in constructing fifa 's interior - a fact which reflects the success of the organization as a whole under blatter 's firm leadership .
during his tenure , fifa has grown from a shaky venture to an international organization with a global scope .
bildunterschrift : the fifa headquarters viewed from outside decisions underground in contrast to many parliamentary buildings , where glassy , transparent exteriors suggest the ability of the outside world to keep an eye on its elected officials , fifa 's underground design closes it off to the public .
the third of its five underground stories contains the executive committee 's meeting chamber .
inside , aluminium walls and a cool , lapis lazuli floor lend the chamber a hermetic and enclosed feel .
" places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light , " said joseph blatter , " because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there . "
here in fifa 's hidden center , a small circle of leaders reach decisions on new reforms , rules , sanctions , legal issues and the conferral of world championships .
sometimes the results of their meetings have a profound impact on soccer worldwide .
the importance of certain questions they discuss explains why the fifa headquarters is constructed the way it is , said joseph blatter .
" it 's more important to me that the employees of fifa have direct access to sunlight rather than the executive committee members , who are only occasionally here in the office , " according to blatter .
" also , the room is closed off so that the result of a vote can not be known until we leave the chamber . "
bildunterschrift : hermetically sealed : the underground meeting room for the executive committee a street of its own fifa 's prayer room is also among the most unusual points of its design .
the onyx room opens upward toward an indirect light and glitters like an oversized diamond .
visitors can enter from one of two sides , and green arrows in the passageways point toward mecca as a service to islamic fifa members .
otherwise , though , the room is bare and cold .
" people of each religion agreed not to include specific religious ornaments in order to create a neutral space for everyone , " said theus .
the sole adornment is two benches inside the prayer space .
the headquarters lie on fifa street , which was approved by the city specifically for the new structure .
" i 'm really proud to be in charge of this ' home of fifa , " ' said blatter and grinned .
after a glimpse inside , it 's easy to see why .
