but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .
opposition joins forces to take on kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition candidates have joined forces in russia but the bureaucratic hurdles and intimidation have n't stopped several opposition candidates from joining forces for an uphill political battle against the kremlin for the presidential elections .
on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .

some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .

lukashenko rules his country with an iron fist but his long reign is based on excellent relations to russia .
however , russian media has been running something of an anti-lukashenko campaign in recent weeks , leading to a significant deterioration in ties between minsk and moscow .
that would make a further russian-belarusian " gas war " in winter likely and could also strongly impact the outcome of the belarusian presidential election .
a new era all signs point toward a worsening of political tensions in eastern europe in the autumn and winter next year .
what 's more : after a total decline in the 1990s and a positive stabilization in the first decade of the 21st century , a new era is emerging in eastern europe .
it 's becoming ever clearer that the political systems created in the past years in post-soviet states have now reached the limit of their authoritarian development potential .
though a future direction still remains unclear , there 's a vague , almost apolitical but growing feeling among the population that things ca n't go on the way they have .

deutsche welle 's russia expert ingo mannteufel urges western europe to pay more attention to the region . largely unnoticed by germany and europe , a deepening sense of crisis has gripped former soviet countries .
more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .
the latest , often negative news from the region , is often interpreted along stereotypes about eastern europe and things are simply left at that .
the consequences that this kind of neglect can lead to was powerfully demonstrated by the russian-georgian war two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel the event came as a total surprise to the european public though it was several months in the making .
and once again the situation in eastern europe is hardly being given any attention despite the fact that the political temperature is set to rise in the autumn following the region 's hot summer .
political turbulence in russia in russia , social protests are growing .
they 're a result of the forest fires that were combated inefficiently .
and now basic food prices are rising too .
the political system created under prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev has suffered a huge loss of public trust .
in addition , there are increasing signs of a conflict between medvedev and his godfather putin ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
further mutual political sparring between the two could create a muddy and instable political situation .
some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .
but kyrgyzstan still faces the possibility of a break-up given that rulers from the bakiyev era in the south remain unwilling to be governed by the country 's new leadership in the north .
and there 's similar political turmoil in countries that lie between russia and the european union .
on oct 31 , ukrainians will vote new local councils for the first time since the election of president viktor yanukovych .
the political system is reported to have strengthened its autocratic tendencies since he took power .
the outcome of the local elections could further inflame the political climate .
in moldova , there are few signs of a quick solution to an ongoing deep political crisis .

a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .

" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .

on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.09.2010 oecd says governments losing battle of the bulge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waistlines are expanding in many developed countries , the oecd says health experts from the organization for economic cooperation and development have expressed alarm at new figures that show obesity in the 33-nation body is on the rise . obesity levels have reached endemic proportions in many industrialized nations , according to a new report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released thursday .
the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 23.09.2010 mobile roaming charges within eu should end , official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes spoke at a conference in brussels european union residents have long complained about exorbitant fees on their cell phone bills while roaming in other eu countries .
now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

it cost him his job .
the catholic church where he worked fired him on ethical grounds in 1997 .
the european court of human rights has ruled this was unfair . the european court of human rights in strasbourg ruled on thursday in favor of church musician bernhard schueth in his case against germany and , by extension , the catholic church .
when the sankt lambertus church in the western german city of essen learned that schueth had found another lover after his marriage fell apart , and that she was expecting a child by him , the parish deacon decided to dismiss him .
after 14 years playing the organ there , schueth left the pipes behind in april 1997 .
like almost all catholic church employees in germany , he had pledged to uphold the values of the religion - and was judged to be in breach of contract .
" sure , i signed that , " schueth said .
" newly-weds always think their marriages will last , and we did everything we could to make it work , but our marriage eventually failed . "
" i was born human , a sexual being , a man .
you ca n't negotiate that in a contract .
your sexuality is part of your humanity , it 's simply non-negotiable . "
the organ player ultimately lost a protracted legal battle that went all the way to the german constitutional court . he then turned to the eu 's highest court for one final appeal - which he won .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the eu 's ' last chance saloon ' on rights issues " the court found that the german labor courts had failed to weigh mr. schueth 's rights against those of the church employer in a manner compatible with the -lrb- european convention on human rights -rrb- , " the strasbourg-based organization explained in a statement .
when rights collide the case involved a " collision of opposing rights , " according to professor stefan muckel , an expert on church law at the university of cologne .
people have the right to have their privacy and their family lives respected , but under german law religious institutions also have the right to make personnel decisions according to the ethical values of their faith , even if these choices are not compatible with standard labor laws .
" german and european courts accept both these principles , and have to weight them against each other on a case-by-case basis , " professor muckel told deutsche welle , adding that he does not expect this individual case to lead to any major changes in german law .
" according to the information released by the court in strasbourg , it seems that the german legal system failed to pay sufficient attention to mr. schueth 's rights in this case . "
as if to prove muckel 's point , the strasbourg court also rejected a similar case of wrongful dismissal on thursday .
a former senior member of the mormon church in germany , michael obst , was sacked for having an extra-marital affair , a decision that the european court deemed to be correct .
a number of mitigating factors helped schueth 's case , the court said : he had kept his new relationship secret , he never remarried , he never took his case to the media or sought to embarrass his local church , and - as an organ player - he had few other career paths open to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some cases , religious texts can trump german labor laws some people in germany are now calling for the labor law exemptions that apply to religious institutions to be refined , especially given that religious institutions here are partially funded by the church tax that registered members of officially recognized german religions pay .
" these laws really need to be limited to key personnel , " rudolf ladwig from the german office of the international league for non-religious and atheists told deutsche welle .
" obviously , a preacher ca n't go to the pulpit and say he values the teachings of buddha over those of jesus christ - then he 's not speaking in the church 's name . "
" but someone like this , an organist , a musician ?
his private life is not relevant to the church 's message , even if he does play the hymns . "
a chance to settle schueth emphasized shortly before the hearing in strasbourg that he considered this a case against the german legal system , which he felt had failed to protect his right to have a relationship .
" i am not fighting against the church , i really hope people understand this , " schueth said .
" instead , i am fighting against the german federal government , which i feel has failed to protect fundamental rights - in my case and perhaps in other , similar ones - that it normally would uphold for all its citizens . "
the court said on thursday that it was not ready to decide on a settlement in the case of mr. schueth , and gave both parties three months to reach an amicable agreement in private .
bernhard schueth currently plays the organ for a protestant church on a part-time basis ; as a registered catholic he is ineligible for full time employment with the protestant church .
he said this week that his dream settlement - the one he has dreamt of since 1997 - would be permission to return to his old job .
" in a sense , my fourth child is in the sankt lambertus church , " he said .
" i am blessed with three wonderful and healthy daughters , but that church houses the organ which i love , and which i helped to build .
i often attend concerts just to listen to it , but i really want to play it again . "

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

but the ministry responsible for the new cards is standing behind its technology . beginning in november 2010 , german citizens who apply to renew their national id cards will receive feature-rich cards capable of storing data-banking information and biometric statistics .
about the size of a standard credit card , the new cards will also enable card-holders to make financial transactions with state authorities over the internet .
the high-tech cards are supposed to provide enhanced security for online purchases .
but this week , the chaos computer club , a german-based group of computer hackers , demonstrated for a wdr television program that they could easily crack the personal identification number -lrb- pin -rrb- of a test model of the new id cards . risky business once a hacker has got hold of the pin , he or she could impersonate the cardholder on the internet and make purchases .
and , he or she could easily change the pin of the card .
" for the card owner , that means he wo n't even be able to access the data on his own card - he wo n't have the pin anymore , " chaos computer club member constanze kurz told the broadcaster wdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of computer hackers easily deciphered the pin in order to make purchases from a home computer , the cardholder inserts his id into a special card reader to verify his identity .
the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- has acknowledged that it is possible to use so-called trojan malware to crack pins when the user is using a simple version of the card reader .
the effect is similar to the ' keystroke ' logging software that records every character typed on a keyboard .
an expensive mistake the government has already spent about 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- for about a million of the basic version of the readers .
experts recommend the use of high-quality readers , which have their own keyboard for entering the pin , in order to foil potential hackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old id cards used holograms to help prevent fraud but the federal office for information security , which developed the cards , has stressed that even with the known weaknesses of the simple card reader , the authentication process is still much safer than a username and password combination .
the id card is still to be introduced according to plan , ministry spokesman tim griese told deutsche welle .
" there are no additional security measures planned in light of the current discussions , " said tim griese of the federal office for information security .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer protection -pipe- 23.09.2010 new german id card easily hacked by ordinary computer nerds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new id cards will debut in november 2010 the highly-touted new national id cards are easily hackable , computer experts say .
but the ministry responsible for the new cards is standing behind its technology . beginning in november 2010 , german citizens who apply to renew their national id cards will receive feature-rich cards capable of storing data-banking information and biometric statistics .
about the size of a standard credit card , the new cards will also enable card-holders to make financial transactions with state authorities over the internet .
the high-tech cards are supposed to provide enhanced security for online purchases .
but this week , the chaos computer club , a german-based group of computer hackers , demonstrated for a wdr television program that they could easily crack the personal identification number -lrb- pin -rrb- of a test model of the new id cards . risky business once a hacker has got hold of the pin , he or she could impersonate the cardholder on the internet and make purchases .
and , he or she could easily change the pin of the card .
" for the card owner , that means he wo n't even be able to access the data on his own card - he wo n't have the pin anymore , " chaos computer club member constanze kurz told the broadcaster wdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of computer hackers easily deciphered the pin in order to make purchases from a home computer , the cardholder inserts his id into a special card reader to verify his identity .
the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- has acknowledged that it is possible to use so-called trojan malware to crack pins when the user is using a simple version of the card reader .
the effect is similar to the ' keystroke ' logging software that records every character typed on a keyboard .
an expensive mistake the government has already spent about 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- for about a million of the basic version of the readers .
experts recommend the use of high-quality readers , which have their own keyboard for entering the pin , in order to foil potential hackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old id cards used holograms to help prevent fraud but the federal office for information security , which developed the cards , has stressed that even with the known weaknesses of the simple card reader , the authentication process is still much safer than a username and password combination .
the id card is still to be introduced according to plan , ministry spokesman tim griese told deutsche welle .
" there are no additional security measures planned in light of the current discussions , " said tim griese of the federal office for information security .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear proliferation -pipe- 23.09.2010 germany joins new international initiative for nuclear disarmament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the 10 countries in the initiative has nuclear weapons ten countries , including germany , have joined together to call for a world without nuclear weapons .
the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council . germany , joining together with nine other countries , has called for renewed efforts to work towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament .
meeting on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york , the 10 countries launched a new initiative to work towards a world without nuclear weapons .
foreign ministers , led by japan and australia , hope to bring new life to efforts for nonproliferation and disarmament .
their mission statement said : " the only guarantee against the use and threat of nuclear weapons is their total elimination . "
germany 's anti-nuclear stance german foreign minister guido westerwelle said they hope to make use of a " window of opportunity " after us president barack obama announced disarmament efforts earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants us nuclear arms held on german soil out westerwelle also warned about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups .
" the more states that arm themselves with nuclear weapons , the greater the risk that terrorists have access to nuclear weapons , " he said .
the foreign minister said this would be " a major threat to security and humanity . "
germany is one of europe ’ s leading voices in advocating non-proliferation and disarmament , and westerwelle has a record of pressuring the us to move faster on removing its weapons from european soil .
the initiative includes canada , chile , germany , mexico , poland , the netherlands , turkey and the united arab emirates – none of which owns nuclear weapons .
the next meeting of the initiative - called the cross-regional group on non-proliferation and disarmament - will be in berlin , said westerwelle .
a security council seat the launch of the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was last on the un security council in 2003-04 five of the 10 non-permanent seats on the council are to be replaced when their term ends in december .
germany is competing against canada and portugal for one of two non-permanent seats on the security council reserved for western states .
just before leaving for new york , westerwelle said germany ’ s " chances are good " but said they would have to " work hard at it " until the election .
the non-permanent members are elected by the general assembly , and germany would need two-thirds of the 192 members to vote for them .
german attempts to join the united states , britain , france , china and russia as a permanent member of the council have been unsuccessful in the past .
however it has been a non-permanent member on four occasions , the last in 2003-2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .

" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council . germany , joining together with nine other countries , has called for renewed efforts to work towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament .
meeting on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york , the 10 countries launched a new initiative to work towards a world without nuclear weapons .
foreign ministers , led by japan and australia , hope to bring new life to efforts for nonproliferation and disarmament .
their mission statement said : " the only guarantee against the use and threat of nuclear weapons is their total elimination . "
germany 's anti-nuclear stance german foreign minister guido westerwelle said they hope to make use of a " window of opportunity " after us president barack obama announced disarmament efforts earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants us nuclear arms held on german soil out westerwelle also warned about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups .
" the more states that arm themselves with nuclear weapons , the greater the risk that terrorists have access to nuclear weapons , " he said .
the foreign minister said this would be " a major threat to security and humanity . "
germany is one of europe ’ s leading voices in advocating non-proliferation and disarmament , and westerwelle has a record of pressuring the us to move faster on removing its weapons from european soil .
the initiative includes canada , chile , germany , mexico , poland , the netherlands , turkey and the united arab emirates – none of which owns nuclear weapons .
the next meeting of the initiative - called the cross-regional group on non-proliferation and disarmament - will be in berlin , said westerwelle .
a security council seat the launch of the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was last on the un security council in 2003-04 five of the 10 non-permanent seats on the council are to be replaced when their term ends in december .
germany is competing against canada and portugal for one of two non-permanent seats on the security council reserved for western states .
just before leaving for new york , westerwelle said germany ’ s " chances are good " but said they would have to " work hard at it " until the election .
the non-permanent members are elected by the general assembly , and germany would need two-thirds of the 192 members to vote for them .
german attempts to join the united states , britain , france , china and russia as a permanent member of the council have been unsuccessful in the past .
however it has been a non-permanent member on four occasions , the last in 2003-2004 .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.09.2010 catholic church loses unfair dismissal case in european court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schueth hopes he can get back to his old job now bernhard schueth 's marriage collapsed , but he found love again .
it cost him his job .
the catholic church where he worked fired him on ethical grounds in 1997 .
the european court of human rights has ruled this was unfair . the european court of human rights in strasbourg ruled on thursday in favor of church musician bernhard schueth in his case against germany and , by extension , the catholic church .
when the sankt lambertus church in the western german city of essen learned that schueth had found another lover after his marriage fell apart , and that she was expecting a child by him , the parish deacon decided to dismiss him .
after 14 years playing the organ there , schueth left the pipes behind in april 1997 .
like almost all catholic church employees in germany , he had pledged to uphold the values of the religion - and was judged to be in breach of contract .
" sure , i signed that , " schueth said .
" newly-weds always think their marriages will last , and we did everything we could to make it work , but our marriage eventually failed . "
" i was born human , a sexual being , a man .
you ca n't negotiate that in a contract .
your sexuality is part of your humanity , it 's simply non-negotiable . "
the organ player ultimately lost a protracted legal battle that went all the way to the german constitutional court . he then turned to the eu 's highest court for one final appeal - which he won .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the eu 's ' last chance saloon ' on rights issues " the court found that the german labor courts had failed to weigh mr. schueth 's rights against those of the church employer in a manner compatible with the -lrb- european convention on human rights -rrb- , " the strasbourg-based organization explained in a statement .
when rights collide the case involved a " collision of opposing rights , " according to professor stefan muckel , an expert on church law at the university of cologne .
people have the right to have their privacy and their family lives respected , but under german law religious institutions also have the right to make personnel decisions according to the ethical values of their faith , even if these choices are not compatible with standard labor laws .
" german and european courts accept both these principles , and have to weight them against each other on a case-by-case basis , " professor muckel told deutsche welle , adding that he does not expect this individual case to lead to any major changes in german law .
" according to the information released by the court in strasbourg , it seems that the german legal system failed to pay sufficient attention to mr. schueth 's rights in this case . "
as if to prove muckel 's point , the strasbourg court also rejected a similar case of wrongful dismissal on thursday .
a former senior member of the mormon church in germany , michael obst , was sacked for having an extra-marital affair , a decision that the european court deemed to be correct .
a number of mitigating factors helped schueth 's case , the court said : he had kept his new relationship secret , he never remarried , he never took his case to the media or sought to embarrass his local church , and - as an organ player - he had few other career paths open to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some cases , religious texts can trump german labor laws some people in germany are now calling for the labor law exemptions that apply to religious institutions to be refined , especially given that religious institutions here are partially funded by the church tax that registered members of officially recognized german religions pay .
" these laws really need to be limited to key personnel , " rudolf ladwig from the german office of the international league for non-religious and atheists told deutsche welle .
" obviously , a preacher ca n't go to the pulpit and say he values the teachings of buddha over those of jesus christ - then he 's not speaking in the church 's name . "
" but someone like this , an organist , a musician ?
his private life is not relevant to the church 's message , even if he does play the hymns . "
a chance to settle schueth emphasized shortly before the hearing in strasbourg that he considered this a case against the german legal system , which he felt had failed to protect his right to have a relationship .
" i am not fighting against the church , i really hope people understand this , " schueth said .
" instead , i am fighting against the german federal government , which i feel has failed to protect fundamental rights - in my case and perhaps in other , similar ones - that it normally would uphold for all its citizens . "
the court said on thursday that it was not ready to decide on a settlement in the case of mr. schueth , and gave both parties three months to reach an amicable agreement in private .
bernhard schueth currently plays the organ for a protestant church on a part-time basis ; as a registered catholic he is ineligible for full time employment with the protestant church .
he said this week that his dream settlement - the one he has dreamt of since 1997 - would be permission to return to his old job .
" in a sense , my fourth child is in the sankt lambertus church , " he said .
" i am blessed with three wonderful and healthy daughters , but that church houses the organ which i love , and which i helped to build .
i often attend concerts just to listen to it , but i really want to play it again . "

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .

they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .

" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .

and , he or she could easily change the pin of the card .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .
they don ’ t want to share their power .
and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .
however , its president faiz ahmad manawi does not seem too worried : " thank god , nothing happened to fundamentally put the electoral process into doubt .
the complaints refer to individual cases .
most of these cases will be investigated .
perhaps some of the fraudulent ballots will be declared invalid . " after last year ’ s presidential elections , investigations led to over a million ballots being discarded by the official count .
it is still too early to predict whether such a scenario will be repeated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women walk past election campaign posters ballots going for 20 us dollars a piece musa fariwar , who himself stood for election , confirmed that there was electoral fraud : " on election day , ballots were even being sold in polling stations - for the equivalent of about 20 us dollars per ballot . " " even before the election , some candidates were not disqualified as they should have been .
certain powerful people had their names put on the ballots so they could exert as much influence as possible on the local circumstances , " nader naderi , the president of the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan , explained . according to the electoral laws , people who support armed militias or have connections to them were not allowed to run .
however , the official election commission seems to have turned a blind eye to certain warlords this time - like in the past . bildunterschrift : the electoral campaign lasted almost three months nader naderi said it was important to not see everything negatively : " we have serious concerns regarding the elections .
however , this does not mean we should ignore what the afghan people achieved on election day .
and it does not mean that foreign experts should use our concern to say that the afghans are not ready for democracy . " so far , election officials have put the turnout at around 36 percent , with over four million people defying taliban intimidation to cast their vote . author : martin gerner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .

that 's why one entrepreneurial firm is building a spanish village on the chinese coast . classy and chic !
these are two words associated with spain and the mediterranean coast .
but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.09.2010 first arctic forum wraps up in moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melting ice means the arctic is opening up faster it 's a hot issue for a cold corner of the world : how to divvy up the arctic and its resources without starting a fight .
that was the focus of the inaugural arctic forum in moscow , which ends thursday . three years ago , a russian submarine crew planted a russian flag on the seabed at the geographical north pole : an unmistakable symbol of russia 's arctic ambitions .
in 2010 , the question of who is entitled to the arctic region and its vast store of resources remains unanswered .
it is this question that is at the heart of the two-day arctic forum in moscow , russia , which ends this thursday .
as global warming shrinks the polar ice , the previously inaccessible area is becoming a potentially rich source of mineral wealth , and arctic border nations russia , canada , the united states , denmark and norway have all laid claim to arctic territory .
the competition is no surprise , given that up to a quarter of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas , as well as gold , diamond , zinc , coal and iron deposits , are believed to lie in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister vladimir putin says peace and cooperation are vital elements of arctic development more than minerals at stake russian prime minister vladimir putin told the conference on thursday that peace and cooperation would prove crucial in the race for arctic resources .
" we think it is imperative to keep the arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation , " he said .
" we have heard futuristic predictions threatening a battle for the arctic .
but we are carefully tracking the situation in the region , and we clearly see that the majority of scary scenarios about the arctic do not have any real basis . "
putin had previously spoken of the arctic 's strategic importance to russia .
" this is where our most important military and marine bases are , " he said .
" it 's over this territory that our bomber planes fly .
this is where major transport routes like the northeast passage lie .
and this is an important location for our cooperation with other countries . "
the kremlin has claimed a 1.2 million square kilometer region of the arctic , an area that includes the north pole itself , and since 2001 , russia has tried – largely unsuccessfully – to have that claim legally recognized by the united nations .
prime minister putin told the moscow conference that he believes all territorial issues in the arctic can be solved by international law .
others in the russian camp hope that scientific data , which centers on an underwater mountain range known as the lomonosov ridge , will see their claims recognized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two freighters successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic last year rival claims " we have to prove that the continental shelf at the bottom of the sea , including the lomonosov ridge , is part of – or to be more precise is an extension of – the mainland .
that 's all , " russian federation arctic council chairman anton vasiliev said .
" but that costs an incredible amount of money and an insane amount of time . "
russia is not the only player putting its faith in the figures : denmark has also argued that the lomonosov ridge is a continuation of danish-ruled greenland , and canada has argued that the shelf lies closer to the canadian ellesmere island than to the russian mainland .
" we will submit our data on the lomonosov ridge , and we are confident that our case will prevail , backed by scientific evidence , " canadian foreign minister lawrence cannon said .
the us , too , has long been looking for data that would prove they too had a right to access the arctic 's natural resources .
but the agenda at the moscow arctic forum , which attracted over 400 politicians and researchers from 15 countries , went beyond questions of which arctic resources should go to whom .
melting could mean disasters " due to what is happening in the arctic region , as a result of melting , more than 800 million people may be faced with an emergency situation , " russian emergencies minister and conference chairman sergei shoigu said .
" we need a common and united search and rescue system .
besides we have to keep in mind what happened in the gulf of mexico . "
shoigu says the question is not whether or not hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic will be exploited , but when , and that exploitation of the region will require a common approach to safety and environmental issues from all countries concerned .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .

they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .
the report said that , in germany , around 60 percent of men and 45 percent of women carried too much weight .
it added that one in six germans fell into the category of morbid obesity .
in europe , germany was bested only by the united kingdom , spain and greece in terms of weight problems .
worldwide frontrunners in the oecd obesity report were the united states and mexico , where nearly 75 percent of women and around 66 percent of men were overweight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad eating habits are a major reason behind the obesity problem the report 's authors noted that increasing weight among young people in oecd countries was another alarming development , adding that too much weight was hanging from the hips of every third child in the bloc .
they said that weight problems could be simply combated through better consultation with family doctors and an improved understanding of nutrition .
a person is regarded as obese when their body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - is above 30 .
a person of normal weight should have a bmi of between 18.5 and 25 .
the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .

"
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "

" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "

but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .

on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .

the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .

" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

that 's why one entrepreneurial firm is building a spanish village on the chinese coast . classy and chic !
these are two words associated with spain and the mediterranean coast .
but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why one entrepreneurial firm is building a spanish village on the chinese coast . classy and chic !
these are two words associated with spain and the mediterranean coast .
but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

that was the focus of the inaugural arctic forum in moscow , which ends thursday . three years ago , a russian submarine crew planted a russian flag on the seabed at the geographical north pole : an unmistakable symbol of russia 's arctic ambitions .
in 2010 , the question of who is entitled to the arctic region and its vast store of resources remains unanswered .
it is this question that is at the heart of the two-day arctic forum in moscow , russia , which ends this thursday .
as global warming shrinks the polar ice , the previously inaccessible area is becoming a potentially rich source of mineral wealth , and arctic border nations russia , canada , the united states , denmark and norway have all laid claim to arctic territory .
the competition is no surprise , given that up to a quarter of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas , as well as gold , diamond , zinc , coal and iron deposits , are believed to lie in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister vladimir putin says peace and cooperation are vital elements of arctic development more than minerals at stake russian prime minister vladimir putin told the conference on thursday that peace and cooperation would prove crucial in the race for arctic resources .
" we think it is imperative to keep the arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation , " he said .
" we have heard futuristic predictions threatening a battle for the arctic .
but we are carefully tracking the situation in the region , and we clearly see that the majority of scary scenarios about the arctic do not have any real basis . "
putin had previously spoken of the arctic 's strategic importance to russia .
" this is where our most important military and marine bases are , " he said .
" it 's over this territory that our bomber planes fly .
this is where major transport routes like the northeast passage lie .
and this is an important location for our cooperation with other countries . "
the kremlin has claimed a 1.2 million square kilometer region of the arctic , an area that includes the north pole itself , and since 2001 , russia has tried – largely unsuccessfully – to have that claim legally recognized by the united nations .
prime minister putin told the moscow conference that he believes all territorial issues in the arctic can be solved by international law .
others in the russian camp hope that scientific data , which centers on an underwater mountain range known as the lomonosov ridge , will see their claims recognized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two freighters successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic last year rival claims " we have to prove that the continental shelf at the bottom of the sea , including the lomonosov ridge , is part of – or to be more precise is an extension of – the mainland .
that 's all , " russian federation arctic council chairman anton vasiliev said .
" but that costs an incredible amount of money and an insane amount of time . "
russia is not the only player putting its faith in the figures : denmark has also argued that the lomonosov ridge is a continuation of danish-ruled greenland , and canada has argued that the shelf lies closer to the canadian ellesmere island than to the russian mainland .
" we will submit our data on the lomonosov ridge , and we are confident that our case will prevail , backed by scientific evidence , " canadian foreign minister lawrence cannon said .
the us , too , has long been looking for data that would prove they too had a right to access the arctic 's natural resources .
but the agenda at the moscow arctic forum , which attracted over 400 politicians and researchers from 15 countries , went beyond questions of which arctic resources should go to whom .
melting could mean disasters " due to what is happening in the arctic region , as a result of melting , more than 800 million people may be faced with an emergency situation , " russian emergencies minister and conference chairman sergei shoigu said .
" we need a common and united search and rescue system .
besides we have to keep in mind what happened in the gulf of mexico . "
shoigu says the question is not whether or not hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic will be exploited , but when , and that exploitation of the region will require a common approach to safety and environmental issues from all countries concerned .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

that was the focus of the inaugural arctic forum in moscow , which ends thursday . three years ago , a russian submarine crew planted a russian flag on the seabed at the geographical north pole : an unmistakable symbol of russia 's arctic ambitions .
in 2010 , the question of who is entitled to the arctic region and its vast store of resources remains unanswered .
it is this question that is at the heart of the two-day arctic forum in moscow , russia , which ends this thursday .
as global warming shrinks the polar ice , the previously inaccessible area is becoming a potentially rich source of mineral wealth , and arctic border nations russia , canada , the united states , denmark and norway have all laid claim to arctic territory .
the competition is no surprise , given that up to a quarter of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas , as well as gold , diamond , zinc , coal and iron deposits , are believed to lie in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister vladimir putin says peace and cooperation are vital elements of arctic development more than minerals at stake russian prime minister vladimir putin told the conference on thursday that peace and cooperation would prove crucial in the race for arctic resources .
" we think it is imperative to keep the arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation , " he said .
" we have heard futuristic predictions threatening a battle for the arctic .
but we are carefully tracking the situation in the region , and we clearly see that the majority of scary scenarios about the arctic do not have any real basis . "
putin had previously spoken of the arctic 's strategic importance to russia .
" this is where our most important military and marine bases are , " he said .
" it 's over this territory that our bomber planes fly .
this is where major transport routes like the northeast passage lie .
and this is an important location for our cooperation with other countries . "
the kremlin has claimed a 1.2 million square kilometer region of the arctic , an area that includes the north pole itself , and since 2001 , russia has tried – largely unsuccessfully – to have that claim legally recognized by the united nations .
prime minister putin told the moscow conference that he believes all territorial issues in the arctic can be solved by international law .
others in the russian camp hope that scientific data , which centers on an underwater mountain range known as the lomonosov ridge , will see their claims recognized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two freighters successfully travelled from asia to europe via the arctic last year rival claims " we have to prove that the continental shelf at the bottom of the sea , including the lomonosov ridge , is part of – or to be more precise is an extension of – the mainland .
that 's all , " russian federation arctic council chairman anton vasiliev said .
" but that costs an incredible amount of money and an insane amount of time . "
russia is not the only player putting its faith in the figures : denmark has also argued that the lomonosov ridge is a continuation of danish-ruled greenland , and canada has argued that the shelf lies closer to the canadian ellesmere island than to the russian mainland .
" we will submit our data on the lomonosov ridge , and we are confident that our case will prevail , backed by scientific evidence , " canadian foreign minister lawrence cannon said .
the us , too , has long been looking for data that would prove they too had a right to access the arctic 's natural resources .
but the agenda at the moscow arctic forum , which attracted over 400 politicians and researchers from 15 countries , went beyond questions of which arctic resources should go to whom .
melting could mean disasters " due to what is happening in the arctic region , as a result of melting , more than 800 million people may be faced with an emergency situation , " russian emergencies minister and conference chairman sergei shoigu said .
" we need a common and united search and rescue system .
besides we have to keep in mind what happened in the gulf of mexico . "
shoigu says the question is not whether or not hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic will be exploited , but when , and that exploitation of the region will require a common approach to safety and environmental issues from all countries concerned .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .

nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 23.09.2010 as elections loom , russian opposition gears up for fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as protests escalate in russia , experts say the political atmosphere is changing russia holds regional polls on october 10 while campaigning has begun for the 2012 presidential poll .
but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .
opposition joins forces to take on kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition candidates have joined forces in russia but the bureaucratic hurdles and intimidation have n't stopped several opposition candidates from joining forces for an uphill political battle against the kremlin for the presidential elections .
on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 23.09.2010 catholic church loses unfair dismissal case in european court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schueth hopes he can get back to his old job now bernhard schueth 's marriage collapsed , but he found love again .
it cost him his job .
the catholic church where he worked fired him on ethical grounds in 1997 .
the european court of human rights has ruled this was unfair . the european court of human rights in strasbourg ruled on thursday in favor of church musician bernhard schueth in his case against germany and , by extension , the catholic church .
when the sankt lambertus church in the western german city of essen learned that schueth had found another lover after his marriage fell apart , and that she was expecting a child by him , the parish deacon decided to dismiss him .
after 14 years playing the organ there , schueth left the pipes behind in april 1997 .
like almost all catholic church employees in germany , he had pledged to uphold the values of the religion - and was judged to be in breach of contract .
" sure , i signed that , " schueth said .
" newly-weds always think their marriages will last , and we did everything we could to make it work , but our marriage eventually failed . "
" i was born human , a sexual being , a man .
you ca n't negotiate that in a contract .
your sexuality is part of your humanity , it 's simply non-negotiable . "
the organ player ultimately lost a protracted legal battle that went all the way to the german constitutional court . he then turned to the eu 's highest court for one final appeal - which he won .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court is the eu 's ' last chance saloon ' on rights issues " the court found that the german labor courts had failed to weigh mr. schueth 's rights against those of the church employer in a manner compatible with the -lrb- european convention on human rights -rrb- , " the strasbourg-based organization explained in a statement .
when rights collide the case involved a " collision of opposing rights , " according to professor stefan muckel , an expert on church law at the university of cologne .
people have the right to have their privacy and their family lives respected , but under german law religious institutions also have the right to make personnel decisions according to the ethical values of their faith , even if these choices are not compatible with standard labor laws .
" german and european courts accept both these principles , and have to weight them against each other on a case-by-case basis , " professor muckel told deutsche welle , adding that he does not expect this individual case to lead to any major changes in german law .
" according to the information released by the court in strasbourg , it seems that the german legal system failed to pay sufficient attention to mr. schueth 's rights in this case . "
as if to prove muckel 's point , the strasbourg court also rejected a similar case of wrongful dismissal on thursday .
a former senior member of the mormon church in germany , michael obst , was sacked for having an extra-marital affair , a decision that the european court deemed to be correct .
a number of mitigating factors helped schueth 's case , the court said : he had kept his new relationship secret , he never remarried , he never took his case to the media or sought to embarrass his local church , and - as an organ player - he had few other career paths open to him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some cases , religious texts can trump german labor laws some people in germany are now calling for the labor law exemptions that apply to religious institutions to be refined , especially given that religious institutions here are partially funded by the church tax that registered members of officially recognized german religions pay .
" these laws really need to be limited to key personnel , " rudolf ladwig from the german office of the international league for non-religious and atheists told deutsche welle .
" obviously , a preacher ca n't go to the pulpit and say he values the teachings of buddha over those of jesus christ - then he 's not speaking in the church 's name . "
" but someone like this , an organist , a musician ?
his private life is not relevant to the church 's message , even if he does play the hymns . "
a chance to settle schueth emphasized shortly before the hearing in strasbourg that he considered this a case against the german legal system , which he felt had failed to protect his right to have a relationship .
" i am not fighting against the church , i really hope people understand this , " schueth said .
" instead , i am fighting against the german federal government , which i feel has failed to protect fundamental rights - in my case and perhaps in other , similar ones - that it normally would uphold for all its citizens . "
the court said on thursday that it was not ready to decide on a settlement in the case of mr. schueth , and gave both parties three months to reach an amicable agreement in private .
bernhard schueth currently plays the organ for a protestant church on a part-time basis ; as a registered catholic he is ineligible for full time employment with the protestant church .
he said this week that his dream settlement - the one he has dreamt of since 1997 - would be permission to return to his old job .
" in a sense , my fourth child is in the sankt lambertus church , " he said .
" i am blessed with three wonderful and healthy daughters , but that church houses the organ which i love , and which i helped to build .
i often attend concerts just to listen to it , but i really want to play it again . "

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .

and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .

"
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .

" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .

"
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer protection -pipe- 23.09.2010 new german id card easily hacked by ordinary computer nerds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new id cards will debut in november 2010 the highly-touted new national id cards are easily hackable , computer experts say .
but the ministry responsible for the new cards is standing behind its technology . beginning in november 2010 , german citizens who apply to renew their national id cards will receive feature-rich cards capable of storing data-banking information and biometric statistics .
about the size of a standard credit card , the new cards will also enable card-holders to make financial transactions with state authorities over the internet .
the high-tech cards are supposed to provide enhanced security for online purchases .
but this week , the chaos computer club , a german-based group of computer hackers , demonstrated for a wdr television program that they could easily crack the personal identification number -lrb- pin -rrb- of a test model of the new id cards . risky business once a hacker has got hold of the pin , he or she could impersonate the cardholder on the internet and make purchases .
and , he or she could easily change the pin of the card .
" for the card owner , that means he wo n't even be able to access the data on his own card - he wo n't have the pin anymore , " chaos computer club member constanze kurz told the broadcaster wdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of computer hackers easily deciphered the pin in order to make purchases from a home computer , the cardholder inserts his id into a special card reader to verify his identity .
the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- has acknowledged that it is possible to use so-called trojan malware to crack pins when the user is using a simple version of the card reader .
the effect is similar to the ' keystroke ' logging software that records every character typed on a keyboard .
an expensive mistake the government has already spent about 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- for about a million of the basic version of the readers .
experts recommend the use of high-quality readers , which have their own keyboard for entering the pin , in order to foil potential hackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old id cards used holograms to help prevent fraud but the federal office for information security , which developed the cards , has stressed that even with the known weaknesses of the simple card reader , the authentication process is still much safer than a username and password combination .
the id card is still to be introduced according to plan , ministry spokesman tim griese told deutsche welle .
" there are no additional security measures planned in light of the current discussions , " said tim griese of the federal office for information security .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

deutsche welle 's russia expert ingo mannteufel urges western europe to pay more attention to the region . largely unnoticed by germany and europe , a deepening sense of crisis has gripped former soviet countries .
more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .
the latest , often negative news from the region , is often interpreted along stereotypes about eastern europe and things are simply left at that .
the consequences that this kind of neglect can lead to was powerfully demonstrated by the russian-georgian war two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel the event came as a total surprise to the european public though it was several months in the making .
and once again the situation in eastern europe is hardly being given any attention despite the fact that the political temperature is set to rise in the autumn following the region 's hot summer .
political turbulence in russia in russia , social protests are growing .
they 're a result of the forest fires that were combated inefficiently .
and now basic food prices are rising too .
the political system created under prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev has suffered a huge loss of public trust .
in addition , there are increasing signs of a conflict between medvedev and his godfather putin ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
further mutual political sparring between the two could create a muddy and instable political situation .
some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .
but kyrgyzstan still faces the possibility of a break-up given that rulers from the bakiyev era in the south remain unwilling to be governed by the country 's new leadership in the north .
and there 's similar political turmoil in countries that lie between russia and the european union .
on oct 31 , ukrainians will vote new local councils for the first time since the election of president viktor yanukovych .
the political system is reported to have strengthened its autocratic tendencies since he took power .
the outcome of the local elections could further inflame the political climate .
in moldova , there are few signs of a quick solution to an ongoing deep political crisis .
but the country will still be holding elections on november 21 .
and in dictatorially-ruled belarus , president alexander lukashenko is set to organize his reelection on december 19 .
lukashenko rules his country with an iron fist but his long reign is based on excellent relations to russia .
however , russian media has been running something of an anti-lukashenko campaign in recent weeks , leading to a significant deterioration in ties between minsk and moscow .
that would make a further russian-belarusian " gas war " in winter likely and could also strongly impact the outcome of the belarusian presidential election .
a new era all signs point toward a worsening of political tensions in eastern europe in the autumn and winter next year .
what 's more : after a total decline in the 1990s and a positive stabilization in the first decade of the 21st century , a new era is emerging in eastern europe .
it 's becoming ever clearer that the political systems created in the past years in post-soviet states have now reached the limit of their authoritarian development potential .
though a future direction still remains unclear , there 's a vague , almost apolitical but growing feeling among the population that things ca n't go on the way they have .
germany and europe would be well-advised to closely follow this political and social process in eastern europe and to actively support it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .

as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council . germany , joining together with nine other countries , has called for renewed efforts to work towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament .
meeting on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york , the 10 countries launched a new initiative to work towards a world without nuclear weapons .
foreign ministers , led by japan and australia , hope to bring new life to efforts for nonproliferation and disarmament .
their mission statement said : " the only guarantee against the use and threat of nuclear weapons is their total elimination . "
germany 's anti-nuclear stance german foreign minister guido westerwelle said they hope to make use of a " window of opportunity " after us president barack obama announced disarmament efforts earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants us nuclear arms held on german soil out westerwelle also warned about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups .
" the more states that arm themselves with nuclear weapons , the greater the risk that terrorists have access to nuclear weapons , " he said .
the foreign minister said this would be " a major threat to security and humanity . "
germany is one of europe ’ s leading voices in advocating non-proliferation and disarmament , and westerwelle has a record of pressuring the us to move faster on removing its weapons from european soil .
the initiative includes canada , chile , germany , mexico , poland , the netherlands , turkey and the united arab emirates – none of which owns nuclear weapons .
the next meeting of the initiative - called the cross-regional group on non-proliferation and disarmament - will be in berlin , said westerwelle .

at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "

new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .

kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .

but the ministry responsible for the new cards is standing behind its technology . beginning in november 2010 , german citizens who apply to renew their national id cards will receive feature-rich cards capable of storing data-banking information and biometric statistics .
about the size of a standard credit card , the new cards will also enable card-holders to make financial transactions with state authorities over the internet .
the high-tech cards are supposed to provide enhanced security for online purchases .
but this week , the chaos computer club , a german-based group of computer hackers , demonstrated for a wdr television program that they could easily crack the personal identification number -lrb- pin -rrb- of a test model of the new id cards . risky business once a hacker has got hold of the pin , he or she could impersonate the cardholder on the internet and make purchases .
and , he or she could easily change the pin of the card .
" for the card owner , that means he wo n't even be able to access the data on his own card - he wo n't have the pin anymore , " chaos computer club member constanze kurz told the broadcaster wdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of computer hackers easily deciphered the pin in order to make purchases from a home computer , the cardholder inserts his id into a special card reader to verify his identity .
the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- has acknowledged that it is possible to use so-called trojan malware to crack pins when the user is using a simple version of the card reader .
the effect is similar to the ' keystroke ' logging software that records every character typed on a keyboard .
an expensive mistake the government has already spent about 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- for about a million of the basic version of the readers .
experts recommend the use of high-quality readers , which have their own keyboard for entering the pin , in order to foil potential hackers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old id cards used holograms to help prevent fraud but the federal office for information security , which developed the cards , has stressed that even with the known weaknesses of the simple card reader , the authentication process is still much safer than a username and password combination .
the id card is still to be introduced according to plan , ministry spokesman tim griese told deutsche welle .
" there are no additional security measures planned in light of the current discussions , " said tim griese of the federal office for information security .

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .
in a ruling against four uk mobile operators , the court noted in a statement at the time that the " object of the regulation is indeed to improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market . "

now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .

" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "
in june , the european court of justice in luxembourg upheld the eu 's right to impose price caps on roaming charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

the body said that extreme overweight was fast becoming the prevalent public health problem in many of its 33 member states .
" if recent trends continue , projections suggest that more than 2 out of 3 people will be overweight or obese in at least some oecd countries within the next 10 years , " the oecd said in the study " obesity and the economics of prevention " .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .

"
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .

"
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .
opposition joins forces to take on kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition candidates have joined forces in russia but the bureaucratic hurdles and intimidation have n't stopped several opposition candidates from joining forces for an uphill political battle against the kremlin for the presidential elections .
on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council . germany , joining together with nine other countries , has called for renewed efforts to work towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament .
meeting on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york , the 10 countries launched a new initiative to work towards a world without nuclear weapons .
foreign ministers , led by japan and australia , hope to bring new life to efforts for nonproliferation and disarmament .
their mission statement said : " the only guarantee against the use and threat of nuclear weapons is their total elimination . "
germany 's anti-nuclear stance german foreign minister guido westerwelle said they hope to make use of a " window of opportunity " after us president barack obama announced disarmament efforts earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants us nuclear arms held on german soil out westerwelle also warned about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups .
" the more states that arm themselves with nuclear weapons , the greater the risk that terrorists have access to nuclear weapons , " he said .
the foreign minister said this would be " a major threat to security and humanity . "
germany is one of europe ’ s leading voices in advocating non-proliferation and disarmament , and westerwelle has a record of pressuring the us to move faster on removing its weapons from european soil .
the initiative includes canada , chile , germany , mexico , poland , the netherlands , turkey and the united arab emirates – none of which owns nuclear weapons .
the next meeting of the initiative - called the cross-regional group on non-proliferation and disarmament - will be in berlin , said westerwelle .
a security council seat the launch of the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was last on the un security council in 2003-04 five of the 10 non-permanent seats on the council are to be replaced when their term ends in december .
germany is competing against canada and portugal for one of two non-permanent seats on the security council reserved for western states .
just before leaving for new york , westerwelle said germany ’ s " chances are good " but said they would have to " work hard at it " until the election .
the non-permanent members are elected by the general assembly , and germany would need two-thirds of the 192 members to vote for them .
german attempts to join the united states , britain , france , china and russia as a permanent member of the council have been unsuccessful in the past .
however it has been a non-permanent member on four occasions , the last in 2003-2004 .

deutsche welle 's russia expert ingo mannteufel urges western europe to pay more attention to the region . largely unnoticed by germany and europe , a deepening sense of crisis has gripped former soviet countries .
more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .
the latest , often negative news from the region , is often interpreted along stereotypes about eastern europe and things are simply left at that .
the consequences that this kind of neglect can lead to was powerfully demonstrated by the russian-georgian war two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel the event came as a total surprise to the european public though it was several months in the making .
and once again the situation in eastern europe is hardly being given any attention despite the fact that the political temperature is set to rise in the autumn following the region 's hot summer .
political turbulence in russia in russia , social protests are growing .
they 're a result of the forest fires that were combated inefficiently .
and now basic food prices are rising too .
the political system created under prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev has suffered a huge loss of public trust .
in addition , there are increasing signs of a conflict between medvedev and his godfather putin ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
further mutual political sparring between the two could create a muddy and instable political situation .
some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .
but kyrgyzstan still faces the possibility of a break-up given that rulers from the bakiyev era in the south remain unwilling to be governed by the country 's new leadership in the north .
and there 's similar political turmoil in countries that lie between russia and the european union .
on oct 31 , ukrainians will vote new local councils for the first time since the election of president viktor yanukovych .
the political system is reported to have strengthened its autocratic tendencies since he took power .
the outcome of the local elections could further inflame the political climate .
in moldova , there are few signs of a quick solution to an ongoing deep political crisis .
but the country will still be holding elections on november 21 .
and in dictatorially-ruled belarus , president alexander lukashenko is set to organize his reelection on december 19 .
lukashenko rules his country with an iron fist but his long reign is based on excellent relations to russia .
however , russian media has been running something of an anti-lukashenko campaign in recent weeks , leading to a significant deterioration in ties between minsk and moscow .
that would make a further russian-belarusian " gas war " in winter likely and could also strongly impact the outcome of the belarusian presidential election .
a new era all signs point toward a worsening of political tensions in eastern europe in the autumn and winter next year .
what 's more : after a total decline in the 1990s and a positive stabilization in the first decade of the 21st century , a new era is emerging in eastern europe .
it 's becoming ever clearer that the political systems created in the past years in post-soviet states have now reached the limit of their authoritarian development potential .
though a future direction still remains unclear , there 's a vague , almost apolitical but growing feeling among the population that things ca n't go on the way they have .
germany and europe would be well-advised to closely follow this political and social process in eastern europe and to actively support it .

fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .

but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 23.09.2010 as elections loom , russian opposition gears up for fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as protests escalate in russia , experts say the political atmosphere is changing russia holds regional polls on october 10 while campaigning has begun for the 2012 presidential poll .
but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .
opposition joins forces to take on kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition candidates have joined forces in russia but the bureaucratic hurdles and intimidation have n't stopped several opposition candidates from joining forces for an uphill political battle against the kremlin for the presidential elections .
on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .

" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

deutsche welle 's russia expert ingo mannteufel urges western europe to pay more attention to the region . largely unnoticed by germany and europe , a deepening sense of crisis has gripped former soviet countries .
more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .
the latest , often negative news from the region , is often interpreted along stereotypes about eastern europe and things are simply left at that .
the consequences that this kind of neglect can lead to was powerfully demonstrated by the russian-georgian war two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel the event came as a total surprise to the european public though it was several months in the making .
and once again the situation in eastern europe is hardly being given any attention despite the fact that the political temperature is set to rise in the autumn following the region 's hot summer .
political turbulence in russia in russia , social protests are growing .
they 're a result of the forest fires that were combated inefficiently .
and now basic food prices are rising too .
the political system created under prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev has suffered a huge loss of public trust .
in addition , there are increasing signs of a conflict between medvedev and his godfather putin ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
further mutual political sparring between the two could create a muddy and instable political situation .
some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .
but kyrgyzstan still faces the possibility of a break-up given that rulers from the bakiyev era in the south remain unwilling to be governed by the country 's new leadership in the north .
and there 's similar political turmoil in countries that lie between russia and the european union .
on oct 31 , ukrainians will vote new local councils for the first time since the election of president viktor yanukovych .
the political system is reported to have strengthened its autocratic tendencies since he took power .
the outcome of the local elections could further inflame the political climate .
in moldova , there are few signs of a quick solution to an ongoing deep political crisis .
but the country will still be holding elections on november 21 .
and in dictatorially-ruled belarus , president alexander lukashenko is set to organize his reelection on december 19 .
lukashenko rules his country with an iron fist but his long reign is based on excellent relations to russia .
however , russian media has been running something of an anti-lukashenko campaign in recent weeks , leading to a significant deterioration in ties between minsk and moscow .
that would make a further russian-belarusian " gas war " in winter likely and could also strongly impact the outcome of the belarusian presidential election .
a new era all signs point toward a worsening of political tensions in eastern europe in the autumn and winter next year .
what 's more : after a total decline in the 1990s and a positive stabilization in the first decade of the 21st century , a new era is emerging in eastern europe .
it 's becoming ever clearer that the political systems created in the past years in post-soviet states have now reached the limit of their authoritarian development potential .
though a future direction still remains unclear , there 's a vague , almost apolitical but growing feeling among the population that things ca n't go on the way they have .
germany and europe would be well-advised to closely follow this political and social process in eastern europe and to actively support it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 23.09.2010 as elections loom , russian opposition gears up for fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as protests escalate in russia , experts say the political atmosphere is changing russia holds regional polls on october 10 while campaigning has begun for the 2012 presidential poll .
but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .

but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

that 's why one entrepreneurial firm is building a spanish village on the chinese coast . classy and chic !
these are two words associated with spain and the mediterranean coast .
but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 23.09.2010 ' draquila ' documentary delivers biting critique of berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the witty movie poster reflects the film 's irreverence a provocative film that rolls out this fall is shaking up european audiences .
' draquila - italy trembles ' offers a disturbing look at italy ’ s democracy through the lens of the l 'aquila earthquake . political satirist sabina guzzanti directed the low-budget film that 's received big budget attention for its disturbing content about the deadly 2009 earthquake , revealed through a mix of interviews , cinema verite and cheeky animation .
the title plays on l 'aquila , the 13th century city devastated by the quake , and , of course , on the famous literary vampire count dracula .
guzzanti casts prime minister silvio berlusconi as a bloodsucker who uses the tragedy to boost his power and revive his flagging popularity . one not so fine day near the start of the film , a cartoon version of prime minister silvio berlusconi gazes at a television set . the media mogul watches gondolas glide along venice 's grand canal . life is beautiful for the billionaire . or so it seems . " spring had just begun on the beautiful peninsula and for silvio berlusconi it was a crappy day like many others , " guzzanti says in the film 's biting voiceover .
bildunterschrift : guzzanti shot more than 700 hours of interviews and footage for her film . back in 2009 , the prime minister was facing corruption charges for the umpteenth time . allegations were swirling that he 'd hosted wild parties attended by prostitutes . his popularity ratings had taken a dive .
the charismatic former cruise ship singer needed to win back his fans , but he had no stage where he could shine .
then on april 6th , at 3:32 a.m. , the earth began to shake . “ it was as if god had once again reached out to give him a hand , ” guzzanti proclaims . in the spotlight berlusconi swept into the earthquake zone looking every bit the part of a politician-saving grace at a natural disaster .
he donned a hard hat and got to work .
he visited the tent city that housed the newly homeless .
bear hugs were delivered , along with plenty of promises to rebuild the city and provide new , seismic-safe housing . he even pledged that every new house would have a bottle of sparkling wine and a cake in the refrigerator .
and the promises did not stop at culinary delights .
one scene in the film shows more than a dozen laborers at a reconstruction site . the men are standing atop the work-in-progress , applauding and cheering the prime minister . " the women ? where are they ? " asked berlusconi , who at the time was facing criticism for his association with a teenage aspiring model . " all of you are gay ? " he joked . " the next time i come , i 'll bring you some showgirls . " in fact he did not deliver any bikini-clad girls like the ones that strut on his television channels , and the national network that he controls .
but guzzanti implies that the promise was nonetheless part of berlusconi 's show .
bildunterschrift : over 90 people died in the nighttime quake after whole blocks of buildings collapsed berlusconi moved the g8 summit to l 'aquila at tremendous expense , but with the guarantee of maximum publicity for the earthquake-fundraising efforts .
with cameras in tow , he guided us president barack obama through the rubble .
the wives of the g8 leaders also visited . berlusconi basked in the glow , according to the film , positioning himself as l 'aquila 's savior . rocky road to salvation however , film footage from a year after the earthquake shows the mayor of l 'aquila walking alone among dusty piles of stone ; it has become a gated and guarded ghost town .
renaissance art is exposed to the elements . the city is still in ruins , as are the lives of it residents .
" i think something is beautiful when it 's real , " guzzanti told deutsche welle . she found inspiration in italy 's neorealist directors who captured the poverty and suffering following world war ii . " you see something , -lrb- and -rrb- even when it hurts ... you watch it , " the 47-year-old director said .
" the courage to look at it is the first step toward finding a cure . "
l 'aquila native cristiana alfonsetti watched the film but says she did n't need to - she 's living it .
" i have also seen with my own eyes what the film described , " she said . " i back it up . " bildunterschrift : did berlusconi cynically use the tragedy to boost his image ?
for two months , the actress lived with 30,000 of her neighbors in the tent city where guzzanti shot many of her 700 hours of footage .
some remained there for five months , through bitter cold and unbearable heat . under lock and key " draquila - italy trembles " reveals that evacuees lost many of their rights along with their homes .
guards patrolled the tent city and barred " undesirable " visitors .
in a disturbing scene , evacuees hang protest signs along the camp 's fence that guards immediately tear down .
residents were prohibited from assembling , and even what they drank was monitored . alcohol , coca-cola and italians ' beloved coffee were banned .
" the reasoning was that they did n't want to agitate the earthquake victims , " said democratic party politician giovanni lolli in an interview shot for the film .
" that 's what i 'm questioning – this oppressive paternalism . " another 30,000 evacuees were put up in seaside hotels , far from their city and work , if they still had it .
many opted to find housing in other cities after it became clear the government was n't moving on reconstruction efforts .
isolated from their former lives , an aftershock of depression struck many . " i 've found many similarities in our experiences to those of prisoners , " said nicoletta bardi , who used to live in l 'aquila 's historic center .
" in jail , you are locked in and ca n't leave . for me , it 's the opposite . i am locked outside my life . "
bildunterschrift : in protest , residents tied their housekeys to a fence bardi , who also saw and appreciated guzzanti 's film , often visits the street where her house is and gazes through the gates .
" it seems like a piece of me remains inside , " said bardi , tears glistening in her eyes . " i miss my city so much . " in a symbolic gesture of protest , residents have tied their house keys to the fence that surrounds the city - there 's no need for keys when the government wo n't let them go home .
crumbling democracy guzzanti 's film stresses that italy 's reaction to the earthquake shows the country 's democracy is on shaky ground . she documents what she sees as a disturbing shift toward authoritarianism .
as an example , she shines the spotlight on italy 's civil protection agency , which oversaw the camp and is handling reconstruction efforts . guzzanti argues that berlusconi has given it sweeping powers that allow it to skirt the law when awarding building contracts .
guido bertolaso , who heads the agency , is already under investigation in another case for allegedly giving contracts to friends .
" i truly believe that there 's an attempt on the part of our government to create a society to its own liking , " cristiana alfonsetti said . “ personally , i find this completely revolting . "
this society is based around a so-called " new town , " a berlusconi-backed urban plan .
the film shows the inauguration of the prefabricated housing project that 's isolated from the old city . the lucky few to land in the identical apartments are thrilled to give tours to guzzanti . they 're happy to have a solid roof over their heads after months in tents .
yet these apartments have few services nearby , and certainly not baroque and romanesque-style churches and a quaint historic center like l 'aquila did .
" they do n't have a city anymore , " guzzanti told deutsche welle .
" they lost everything and -lrb- yet -rrb- they feel very grateful and happy . "
" this is the irony and shows us the power of propaganda . how you can steal everything from someone and make him happy . " guzzanti is a longtime berlusconi critic but takes swipes at his opposition on the political left , as well . she also skewers journalists .
both are accused of failing to react to these alleged abuses of power and ignoring the continued lack of progress . yet guzzanti 's reaction , draquila , is getting attention . it 's a box-office success - a rarity for a documentary . residents , however , are still waiting to see if it will bring a holler of " action " for l 'aquila and for italy 's democracy .

the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council . germany , joining together with nine other countries , has called for renewed efforts to work towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament .
meeting on the sidelines of the un general assembly in new york , the 10 countries launched a new initiative to work towards a world without nuclear weapons .
foreign ministers , led by japan and australia , hope to bring new life to efforts for nonproliferation and disarmament .
their mission statement said : " the only guarantee against the use and threat of nuclear weapons is their total elimination . "
germany 's anti-nuclear stance german foreign minister guido westerwelle said they hope to make use of a " window of opportunity " after us president barack obama announced disarmament efforts earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants us nuclear arms held on german soil out westerwelle also warned about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups .
" the more states that arm themselves with nuclear weapons , the greater the risk that terrorists have access to nuclear weapons , " he said .
the foreign minister said this would be " a major threat to security and humanity . "
germany is one of europe ’ s leading voices in advocating non-proliferation and disarmament , and westerwelle has a record of pressuring the us to move faster on removing its weapons from european soil .
the initiative includes canada , chile , germany , mexico , poland , the netherlands , turkey and the united arab emirates – none of which owns nuclear weapons .
the next meeting of the initiative - called the cross-regional group on non-proliferation and disarmament - will be in berlin , said westerwelle .
a security council seat the launch of the new initiative comes as germany tries to boost its chances of being elected to a seat on the un security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was last on the un security council in 2003-04 five of the 10 non-permanent seats on the council are to be replaced when their term ends in december .
germany is competing against canada and portugal for one of two non-permanent seats on the security council reserved for western states .
just before leaving for new york , westerwelle said germany ’ s " chances are good " but said they would have to " work hard at it " until the election .
the non-permanent members are elected by the general assembly , and germany would need two-thirds of the 192 members to vote for them .
german attempts to join the united states , britain , france , china and russia as a permanent member of the council have been unsuccessful in the past .
however it has been a non-permanent member on four occasions , the last in 2003-2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

18 independent election observers in kabul have reported that 4,000 complaints of electoral fraud and irregularities had been lodged by tuesday afternoon .
some four million voters are thought to have cast their ballot . over 4,000 written complaints of fraud and irregularities from all parts of afghanistan were filed with the afghan electoral complaint commission by tuesday afternoon ’ s official deadline . thousands of complaints about electoral violations were also received during the nearly three-month campaign .
many citizens are angry about the electoral process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah abdullah , who lost the presidential election to hamid karzai , has expressed his " concern " about possible fraud " it 's not the afghan population that is responsible for electoral fraud , it ’ s the government .

and those who are responsible are those who have no interest in the elections taking place in a democratic way and are not convinced of the sovereignty of the law , " faizullah jalali , a lecturer at kabul university 's law faculty , said . many of the complaints say that government representatives and local powerbrokers openly tried to rig the votes .
there are allegations of ballot stuffing , double voting and underage voting . pressure on karzai and iec president karzai and the newly-compiled independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- are likely to come under considerable pressure . the iec will have to prove that it is not simply an extended arm of the president .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 23.09.2010 japan 's newest favorite son on the rise in soccer-mad dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinji kagawa is fast becoming a fan favourite at dortmund most foreign players take a while to settle in a new country and league .
those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 23.09.2010 mobile roaming charges within eu should end , official says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes spoke at a conference in brussels european union residents have long complained about exorbitant fees on their cell phone bills while roaming in other eu countries .
now the eu 's digital agenda commissioner says she will propose banning them . european union roaming charges are an " outdated concept " and should be abolished by law , eu digital agenda commissioner neelie kroes said in a speech on thursday .
" i will assess the structural , economic and legal barriers to such a true single market and i am not afraid to propose the necessary measures to overcome these , " kroes said .
speaking at the european telecommunications network operators association -lrb- etno -rrb- conference in brussels , she added that the 27-member bloc should be considered as a single economic market .
as such , the eu should order that prices of mobile voice , text and data services be based on the true cost of providing those services , she said , rather than allowing mobile operators to tack on exorbitant fees when crossing national borders within the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament capped fees in 2008 previous regulation upheld three years ago , her predecessor , viviane reding , proposed caps on these roaming fees , which were then adopted by the european parliament in 2008 and lowered further earlier this year .
" we will not be proposing another barrier , and nor will we propose endless tweaking of the current price capping arrangement without adding anything new , " kroes added .
" i want the gap between roaming and domestic prices to approach zero . "

that 's why one entrepreneurial firm is building a spanish village on the chinese coast . classy and chic !
these are two words associated with spain and the mediterranean coast .
but the trip still costs far too much for the average chinese tourist and this is where china merchants zhangzhou group limited sees its future . over the next eight years , the firm is going to build a massive vacation complex for tens of thousands near the southeastern city of zhangzhou in fujian province .
at its heart , alongside amusement parks and shopping malls , there will be a " real " mediterranean village – a replica of cadaques on the costa brava , which once was a favorite spot of the surrealist painter salvador dali . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrealist painter salvador dali spent much of his childhood in cadaques a 12-member delegation from zhangzhou recently went to the real spanish village to take notes .
" they photographed everything , took down measurements and asked hundreds of questions , " says the head of cadaques ' building authority , valenti serinana . " they wanted to know everything , how the houses were built , what they looked like inside , the exact sloping of the streets … they were even interested in the church , " serinana said . what was surprising to him was that " they have found a place on the coast of zhangzhou , which is practically identical to the mountains and the coast here . " recreating the atmosphere of a spanish heritage site apparently , the firm does not want to build an exact replica of the village but wants to somehow recreate the atmosphere .
however , the dali museum will be exactly the same , with part of the new village being reserved for galleries and artists . the chinese delegation first fell in love with cadaques over the internet .
not far from the french border , it is a spanish heritage site , which harks back to the days when the whole coast looked like this – white houses , tiled roofs , beautiful courtyards and narrow , winding lanes . bildunterschrift : the beautiful village is a spanish heritage site " the color scheme is one of the secrets , " explained serinana .
" white , dark green , red and blue , that ’ s all . "
the coastal village huddled under the mountains is protected by its architecture from the sun and the wind . the replica will draw more tourists to the original when asked whether it rankled him that the chinese wanted to copy his village , serinana was quick to play down any such ideas . " on the contrary !
they told us that it would make more and more chinese want to visit the original because increasing numbers are going to be able to afford foreign travel in future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although parts of the coast near zhangzhou may resemble the costa brava the climate conditions are very different this is not an unwelcome prospect , considering cadaques lives from tourism . seranina and other representatives from cadaques plan to visit china in the fall .
" zhangzhou wants to set up a twin city scheme with us , " said seranina . it might be a somewhat uneven partnership – cadaques has 3,000 inhabitants in winter and 15,000 in summer , whereas zhangzhou has 400,000 all year round – but it will be a further step in bringing the mediterranean flair to china . author : reiner wandler / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

the authority claimed google was taking photographs from too high up , intruding on residents ' privacy . the czech data protection authority said wednesday it had banned internet giant google from taking photographs for its street view service due to privacy invasion .
" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .
" czech law says that any firm with its headquarters outside the european union that collects data in the czech republic must establish a legal entity to represent the firm in the czech republic , " nemec said .
" google incorporated has not done that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities said they would reconsider if google lowered the camera google czech republic , which the data protection authority does not recognize as google inc . 's representative in the country , said in a statement it was disappointed in the outcome but would work to promote street view 's success in the czech republic .
" we 'll continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the data protection authority to answer any other questions they have , " they stated , adding , " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , and we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . "
google also claimed that the height of the mast had been chosen to avoid photographing pedestrians ' heads , which could block the buildings , street signs and other landmarks it was designed to capture .
google has been under fire in a number of countries over privacy and data collection concerns - most recently in germany , switzerland , and the united kingdom .
igor nemec said he and other eu data protection officials would meet with google representatives in brussels on october 12 .

" we have a problem with google using cameras high up to collect their data , " the office 's director igor nemec said of the photographic mapping service . nemec said google was using " a camera that is 2.7 meters -lrb- 8.9 feet -rrb- off the ground - which is an invasion of the privacy of our citizens , several of whom have filed complaints to us . "
nemec added that street view images were so detailed that one man had even complained the number of shoes outside his front door was clearly visible online , indicating how many people lived in his house .
others complained of the camera peeking over fences and hedges and into their living rooms .
" from our point of view it would be correct if the cameras were lower , " nemec said .
google vows to forge on the czech data protection authority also took issue with google 's legal status in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.09.2010 moscow is happy with the eu 's ' neighborhood policy ' , for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's borders are moving ever closer to moscow for years , brussels has offered financial and social incentives to nearby countries striving for economic and political stability .
but it 's a strategy that might eventually cause friction with moscow . one of the eu 's primary goals is to avoid or defuse any conflicts with neighboring countries , and in 2004 the bloc drafted its " european neighborhood policy " -lrb- enp -rrb- to help it achieve that goal .
under the scheme , brussels reaches out to countries close to the eu 's borders , offering financial aid , free or freer travel within the bloc , and potential entry into the european common market to countries prepared to work towards improving their economic and political stability .
" the neighborhood policy is our only real tool to strengthen the stability and prosperity around us , " eu expansion commissioner stefan fuele said , explaining that the premise is to prevent problems early , rather than trying to cure them later .
" it is considered cheaper and more effective than tackling the spillover of breakdown or even continued instability in any of the countries surrounding the european union . "
earlier this year , the eu 's expansion commission was put in charge of running the enp .
nevertheless , brussels says enp membership does not mean a country is necessarily on the path to eu membership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuele says that stronger neighbors help the eu as well most of the 16 countries which benefit from the enp currently fall well short of eu accession criteria , though the point of the program is to bring them closer into line with european norms .
looking east there are also countries close to the eu 's borders which are not part of the policy .
in eastern europe , for instance , moldova and ukraine are well integrated into the system , while belarus does not participate .
" our door is open , that 's always been the case , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt said , stressing that the final decision on whether to join rests with belarus .
" the degree of cooperation within these partnerships is going to be dependent on their -lrb- the respective countries ' -rrb- state of internal affairs . "
ever since the enp 's inception , politicians and analysts worried that the policy might cause friction with russia - especially when dealing with former soviet satellite states , which moscow considers to be within its sphere of influence .
if handled poorly , experts warned , brussels might give the impression that it was trying to muscle in on russia 's territory .
" we do n't want to see competition between russia on the one side and the eu on the other in that region , we want to see cooperation , " expansion commissioner fuele told deutsche welle .
russia happy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : healthy trade , especially in natural gas , keeps eu-russian relations stable the government in russia is also largely unfazed by the eu 's involvement in the former soviet region , and says that provided moscow and brussels are pulling in similar directions , the policy will help all concerned .
" we all want to make sure that the countries who happen to be neighbors of both the european union and the russian federation are stable , prosperous and peaceful , of course , " foreign minister sergey lavrov said of the enp .
" i believe we can discuss many things with the eu that would be helpful in bringing about this outcome . "
lavrov added that it was to be expected that both the eu and russia both look to cooperate with their neighbors with various organizations , institutions and programs .
" the main thing is that these cooperative arrangements , these integration processes on both sides are not contradicting each other , but rather are made mutually compatible and complimentary . "
current concerns , future questions relations between the eu and russia have been strained occasionally in recent years , most dramatically during the brief war between georgia and russia in 2008 .
repeated natural gas payment disputes between russia and ukraine , a key transit nation for europe , have also led to occasional gas delivery shortfalls for some eu members in the past few years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enp member georgia is hardly on good terms with russia most recently , in june this year , a similar spat over gas payments between russia and belarus briefly left eu member lithuania with next-to-no natural gas deliveries , a problem which elicited an uncharacteristically strong reaction from brussels .
" it 's not a problem for this one member state -lrb- lithuania -rrb- , it 's a problem , it 's an attack against the whole european union , " the eu 's energy commissioner guenther oettinger said at the time .
these disagreements , however , were not really caused , exacerbated by , or related to the european neighborhood policy .
russia 's current stance is that stability and prosperity in former soviet satellite states is in moscow 's best interest , and eu help towards this goal is arguably a weight off the kremlin 's shoulders .
that positive russian appraisal of the situation might change , however , if opportunities for eu membership were eventually incorporated into the enp .
currently , participation in the scheme is neutral on this issue ; it does n't promise a country the chance of membership but it does n't rule out the possibility either .
however , successful members of the enp who make positive strides improving their economic and democratic credentials do , by extension , make themselves stronger candidates to one day pass the various accession criteria set by brussels for would-be eu members .

those from the far east often find europe a particular struggle .
new signing shinji kagawa , however , looks like he was born to play in dortmund . nothing cements a player in the hearts of the borussia dortmund faithful more than winning the match against hated rivals schalke 04 in the revierderby .
just imagine , then , how loved shinji kagawa must be after scoring twice and putting in a man-of-the-match performance against the royal blues in dortmund 's first win over the gelsenkirchen side in three years .
kagawa 's arrival in the summer raised a few eyebrows in dortmund and when michael zorc , dortmund 's sporting director , said the 21-year-old japan international would score goals for the team , those expressions of surprise were joined by titters of disbelief .
nobody is laughing now .
the 350,000-euro deal dortmund secured for kagawa 's services already looks like one of the bargains of the season .
the former cerezo osaka midfielder has hit three goals in five bundesliga games so far this season as well as a couple in the europa league to silence the doubters and endear himself to the bvb faithful .
they really need n't have been so dismissive : kagawa hit 55 goals in 123 appearances for his japanese side before making the move to europe and had been scouted by both barcelona and real madrid before dortmund swooped .
his goals were the driving force behind osaka 's promotion to the top division in the j-league two seasons ago .
his star is also on the rise in the international arena .
after playing through all the levels and age groups in the national set-up , and featuring at the beijing olympics as a precocious 19-year-old , kagawa is now on his way to becoming established as an integral member of the senior japan side .
he 's featured 13 times and scored two goals to date and many expect him to be a fixture in the japanese midfield for years to come .
box-to-box midfielder with a lot of heart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa 's all-action game is exactly what the bvb fans love the kobe-born starlet , who was famously bowled over by the " most beautiful blondes " he 'd ever seen on his arrival in germany , is now himself turning heads in one of the most passionate soccer regions in the country .
dortmund fans love all-action players who play like they would die for the team and the slightly built , box-to-box midfielder is made to measure .
it appears to be a marriage made in soccer heaven .
kagawa is a tireless runner with a lung-busting work rate .
he can use his stamina and pace to maraud like a man possessed or take his foot off the gas to allow his soccer brain and vision to create space and time for others with a killer pass .
his range and versatility have already reaped rewards and drawn praise from his peers .
" the boy plays like an angel , " fellow midfielder nuri sahin has been quoted as saying . " he 's a great addition , " according to bvb captain sebastian kehl .
kagawa provides offensive bvb with attacking options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's strikers are reaping the benefits of kagawa 's skill kagawa 's flexibility gives this attack-minded dortmund team a scary amount of options .
he can operate in the hole behind the attackers , arriving late in the box to strike , or can push forward from his floating position to hit dangerous shots from a distance .
his strike rate for a young midfielder is enviable and one of the main reasons bvb coach juergen klopp is so excited about him .
" kagawa is an agile and versatile player — an outstanding talent , " klopp enthused after the youngster 's two-goal haul against schalke .
" it was a great team effort and shinji played a huge part in that .
his first goal was fantastic . "
mostly right-footed but with a strong left , kagawa is a striker 's dream , known for clever assists with his range of short and long passes from either foot .
he can also go it alone and has wonderful ball control and dribbling ability which , coupled with his lightweight frame and speed , makes him a nightmare proposition for beefy , immobile defenders .
lightweight but fast , shinji eyes the biggest prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund coach klopp is full of praise for kagawa however , this lightness can also be a disadvantage .
kagawa may not be the strongest player on the pitch and faced with rugged opponents of equal guile and pace , he can often be too easily knocked off the ball .
he does need to be caught first , though .
as with many japanese players , he is not the best in the air but with fast , clever feet , kagawa 's job at bvb will not be challenging for balls at corners and free kicks .
he 's also a young man with ambition and has been quoted as saying his target is to play in the champions league .
should his form and inspiration push dortmund towards those heights , he may get his wish sooner than he expected .
if not , it is unlikely that a player of kagawa 's talent will be denied his chance to grace europe 's premier club competition for long .

the planes are used for taking aerial photos and reconnaissance rather than attack . germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg informed parliament on thursday that he is withdrawing tornado jet reconnaissance planes from afganistan and deploying other military personnel instead .
the six planes have been in action in afghanistan for three and a half years and are generally used for taking aerial photographs and their advanced infrared sensors .
" the reallocation is in line with the already planned replacement of the aircraft in november 2010 , " said a briefing note from the department of defense .
the commander of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , general david petraeus had previously urged berlin to send in army personnel instead of airmen .
the removal of the tornados frees up 90 job slots for army personnel to meet petraeus ' needs .
it is likely they will be freed up to train the afghan security forces .
germany 's troop contingent with the isaf is limited by parliament to 5,350 personnel .

but it 's not all business as usual .
a new opposition group plans to take on the ruling duo of putin and medvedev . election fever is sweeping russia .
on october 10 , the country holds regional parliamentary elections in places such as tuva , belgorod , novosibirsk and chelyabinsk while regions such as samara will elect a local mayor .
in addition , local council elections will be held on the same day in several regions .
but campaign fever is n't just confined to select regions in russia .
observers say the election campaign for presidential elections in march 2012 has long kicked off too .
the main players are prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev and both are increasingly presenting themselves as strong leaders in times of crisis .
putin outshines medvedev in media battle putin ratcheted up his media presence during the fight against forest fires in russia this summer .
similarly , medvedev made a public show of keeping a lid on prices in supermarkets in the light of rising food prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , left , is much more media-savvy than his hand-picked successor medvedev but it 's putin who has the edge when it comes to being media-savvy , according to russian political analyst pavel tolstych .
" of course , putin is very telegenic .
he knows how to communicate with journalists , he can conduct debates well and can make jokes in his own style , " tolstych said .
" medvedev ca n't keep up with him when it comes to keeping the public in good spirits .
he also does n't have what it takes to be a russian ' macho . '
putin 's time has come and medvedev now will take second place in the media campaign . "
but experts believe the development is n't scripted .
putin and medvedev are said to have made a deal that putin would become russia 's next president in 2012 and many believe the two will stick to it .
tolstych also played down speculation of serious differences within the kremlin or the government .
but not everybody shares that view .
alexander rahr , a russia expert , from the german council for foreign affairs said the two leaders represented two different political outlooks : putin stood for a conservative modernization of russia while medvedev for a liberal one .
the russia expert is convinced that voters are slowly beginning to pick up on the differences and political nuances of the leadership duo .
and that 's already begun to affect the views and desires of the voters .
slow but perceptible change rahr also pointed out that the results of regional elections in early 2010 show that the political atmosphere in russia is changing .
putin 's party , united russia , may have won the elections but the opposition also garnered enough votes to be taken seriously and become a real political force in the country , he said .
the opposition also plans to contest the upcoming regional elections in october .
russian authorities have already allowed their candidates to compete .
all in all the process was peaceful , according to aleksandr kynjev from the russian non-governmental organization " golos " which focuses on voters ' rights .
but he pointed out a few " scandalous " examples of opposition candidates barred from contesting .
" one candidate from samara was n't allowed because his id card contained an entry saying his passport had expired .
the authorities then declared the id card to be invalid though they had made that entry themselves , " kynjev said .
he added that in other cases , candidates were barred from standing for election because they allegedly had n't signed the applications themselves or had allegedly left the forms incomplete by failing to fill out certain fields .

on september 16 , a group of prominent opposition leaders formed a coalition called " russia without corruption and lawlessness " to challenge putin and medvedev .
the coalition represents a further attempt alongside the " other russia " opposition party to unite the country 's opposition forces against the two large pro-kremlin parties united russia and fair russia .
but experts warn that past attempts to unite an often fractured opposition against the kremlin have often failed due to political jostling .
" personal ambitions are always the problem .
it 's clear that everyone wants to be the boss .
each one of them has been in a top position in the past , " russian political affairs expert leonid radsichovskij said .
" but now we perhaps have the last attempt to unite .
the opposition is hoping that the situation improves and that the russian public pays more attention to them . "
the new coalition said the election campaign would offer the opposition to champion change .
boris nemtsov , who once served as deputy premier under president boris yeltsin , said the new coalition will continue holding street rallies that have mostly been banned or dispersed in recent years .
the " russia without corruption and lawlessness " group has announced that it plans to contest the parliamentary elections next year as well as field a presidential candidate for the 2012 poll .

deutsche welle 's russia expert ingo mannteufel urges western europe to pay more attention to the region . largely unnoticed by germany and europe , a deepening sense of crisis has gripped former soviet countries .
more than any other region of the world , russia and its neighbors are hugely important for the peace and prosperity of the european continent .
still , disinterest and ignorance about these countries unfortunately remains widespread in western europe .
the latest , often negative news from the region , is often interpreted along stereotypes about eastern europe and things are simply left at that .
the consequences that this kind of neglect can lead to was powerfully demonstrated by the russian-georgian war two years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel the event came as a total surprise to the european public though it was several months in the making .
and once again the situation in eastern europe is hardly being given any attention despite the fact that the political temperature is set to rise in the autumn following the region 's hot summer .
political turbulence in russia in russia , social protests are growing .
they 're a result of the forest fires that were combated inefficiently .
and now basic food prices are rising too .
the political system created under prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev has suffered a huge loss of public trust .
in addition , there are increasing signs of a conflict between medvedev and his godfather putin ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
further mutual political sparring between the two could create a muddy and instable political situation .
some observers have already begun comparing it to the early years of mikhail gorbachev when gorbachev tried to tackle the crisis of soviet communism with radical reform policies , thereby triggering a domestic political power struggle .
much like the nuclear catastrophe of chernobyl of 1986 , the forest fires this summer could prove to be a catalyst for simmering public dissatisfaction with daily living conditions .
but the anger of many russians is not targeted so much at putin as it is toward the representatives of his bureaucracy .
an important indicator of the further public mood in the country will be seen on october 10 this year when a few regional and hundreds of local elections are held .
if putin 's party fails to show expected results despite its vast administrative resources , it would be a bad omen for the presidential election in 2012 and a shock for the ruling elite .
political tensions rise in post-soviet states but it 's not just russia that faces a heated election season in autumn .
the situation in a few other post-soviet states is even more tense .
kyrgyzstan holds parliamentary elections on october 10 that are hoped to stabilize the country after a bloody coup against president kurmanbek bakiyev that sparked ethnic clashes .
but kyrgyzstan still faces the possibility of a break-up given that rulers from the bakiyev era in the south remain unwilling to be governed by the country 's new leadership in the north .
and there 's similar political turmoil in countries that lie between russia and the european union .
on oct 31 , ukrainians will vote new local councils for the first time since the election of president viktor yanukovych .
the political system is reported to have strengthened its autocratic tendencies since he took power .
the outcome of the local elections could further inflame the political climate .
in moldova , there are few signs of a quick solution to an ongoing deep political crisis .
but the country will still be holding elections on november 21 .
and in dictatorially-ruled belarus , president alexander lukashenko is set to organize his reelection on december 19 .
lukashenko rules his country with an iron fist but his long reign is based on excellent relations to russia .
however , russian media has been running something of an anti-lukashenko campaign in recent weeks , leading to a significant deterioration in ties between minsk and moscow .
that would make a further russian-belarusian " gas war " in winter likely and could also strongly impact the outcome of the belarusian presidential election .
a new era all signs point toward a worsening of political tensions in eastern europe in the autumn and winter next year .
what 's more : after a total decline in the 1990s and a positive stabilization in the first decade of the 21st century , a new era is emerging in eastern europe .
it 's becoming ever clearer that the political systems created in the past years in post-soviet states have now reached the limit of their authoritarian development potential .
though a future direction still remains unclear , there 's a vague , almost apolitical but growing feeling among the population that things ca n't go on the way they have .
germany and europe would be well-advised to closely follow this political and social process in eastern europe and to actively support it .

the oecd paper said the reasons for the obesity surge included a reduction in the price of calories , altered living and working conditions that have reduced the amount of daily physical activity , increased stress levels and longer working hours .

deutsche welle spoke with annika soeder , assistant director-general of the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations about the path ahead for the millennium goals .
soeder is in charge of the faos office of un coordination and mdgs follow-up .
deutsche welle : what did you make of the summit declaration ?
annika soeder : it 's taking stock of many earlier commitments , and it 's always good that commitments are being renewed , but we need more delivery from all strands in order to be able to achieve the goals .
i think it 's possible , but we need more input from all stakeholders … i 'm looking for commitments from rich countries to help more .
i 'm looking for commitments from poor countries to do more together with their people to change their hunger situation .
and i also look for change in some global policies , like trade policies and the agricultural policies of the rich world , which is actually destroying the possibilities for many poor countries .
so what now that this summit is over ?
should , for example , several countries be held accountable for progress , or lack thereof ?
should there be an annual results-based discussion ?
there should be a results-based discussion and we should know more about the achievements in different countries .
i 'm not at all against having some kind of scoreboard where we look at the achievements .
then we have to recognize that it 's not all about achieving and contributing to the individual goals .
they all work together , and it 's all about development , about solving development situations in general and not only about the individual goals and targets .
but i 'm very much in favor of showing more of the results and showing more of the gaps that we need to fill , because i think such peer reviews will help countries to work harder and achieve more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soeder says there are still nearly 1 billion people suffering from chronic hunger so how can you hold countries responsible ?
well i think one way to hold them responsible is to show the achievements and the lack of achievements , without blaming but just by telling .
this will also help people in various countries hold their governments accountable .
and how about the progress on millennium development goal 1 -lrb- mdg1 -rrb- to halve hunger by 2015 ?
mdg1 and the target on hunger is not on track because more than 900 million people are actually suffering from chronic hunger .
we know it 's possible to change that , but we need a lot of political will and a lot of work to be able to do that in five years , so it 's quite a dramatic situation .
do you think mdg1 is reachable ?
it is reachable if we change policies and if we do the right things .
many countries show that it 's possible : ghana , nicaragua , malawi , vietnam , and others .
but still , so many people suffer .
it 's a silent and ongoing disaster that we really need to speak about , and we need to urge leaders in poor countries and in rich countries to take their responsibility to make this change happen .
you say there are countries that are fighting hunger successfully .
what is it that they 're doing right ?
they 're challenging the policy environment by investing more public money into facilitating agriculture for people to be able to produce food and then get income and be able to buy food .
they invest in roads , so the food can get out and be sold .
they invest in irrigation , invest in storage , invest in women , because in many poor countries the women are the ones who actually deal with the land and produce the food .
so through those means many countries have achieved , but it 's still a very long way to go , and that is why the fao , together with many other partners in the united nations and in civil society , we blow the whistle on this ongoing disaster because we really feel we need to give a voice to all these people who are hungry .

but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.09.2010 siemens agrees to open-ended employment guarantee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has 3,000 vacant positions , primarily for engineers with 3,000 vacant jobs and a shortage of qualified candidates , siemens has agreed to give all its workers open-ended employment guarantees .
but the marketplace demands a flexible approach to staffing , one expert says . as companies worldwide chip away at job security for employees in the interest of maintaining a flexible work force , electronics manufacturer siemens has made its employees an unprecedented offer .
all 128,000 siemens employees in germany – including those working in its subsidiaries – have been given an open-ended employment guarantee .
the company may move to withdraw from the agreement in 2013 at the earliest .
a previous agreement from 2008 covered only 95,000 employees and expires at the end of september .
but the move is n't necessarily altruistic .
many aspects of the global recession are over , but german companies are experiencing a shortage of highly qualified workers , such as engineers .
at siemens alone there are now 3,000 vacancies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar adler of siemens ' combined work council praised the agreement lothar adler , head of siemens ' combined work council , said the previous , limited agreement to not engage in layoffs weathered the crisis , which is something the company recognizes .
as an alternative , as many as 19,000 employees had their hours temporarily reduced for a period of time .
the open-ended expansion of the agreement is “ both sensible and oriented towards the future of both the employees and the company , ” given current economic and social conditions , he said .
not necessarily enforceable but susanne kohaut , of the research institute of the federal employment agency in nuremberg , pointed out that employers other than siemens have broken similar agreements in the past .
“ it 's not a really an enforceable right , ” she told deutsche welle .
other german companies including daimler , volkswagen and the deutsche bahn currently grant similar guarantees , and kohaut also explained that is one way for employers to better recruit and keep a qualified workforce .
“ it 's good for their image , ” she said .
“ and one does n't lay off engineers when one thinks they might urgently be needed again in three years .
instead one keeps qualified workers and qualified employees , and does n't suffer from the negative image of mass layoffs .
and when one sees a way forward , when things start picking up again , then one can rely on those people . ”
flexibility still called for bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : layoffs are a thing of the past at siemens ... at least until 2013 stephan teuber , vice president of the federal association of german management consultants , described the move as an opportunity for siemens to revitalize its tarnished image .
“ siemens has had a very severe austerity policy – one could almost say a restructuring policy – and they were subject to corruption investigation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ they found themselves the targets of severe criticism . ”
according to teuber , it has been known for years that a retirement wave will soon diminish the ranks of engineers and other highly qualified workers in germany , simply based on statistical ages and university graduation dates .
while the recession may have stalled the effect by about a year , intense competition over remaining and new employees is sure to be intense , he said .
“ this reduces the chances that people will switch to other employers at the moment , ” he said .
but teuber also foresees a problem with the new contract between siemens and its employees .
flexibility is called for in a consistently changing market environment , he says .
whether siemens employees will be willing to relocate or switch to different jobs remains to be seen .
“ an employment guarantee is n't a pillow they can just relax on , but of course very secure employment does n't exactly foster flexibility , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 23.09.2010 national strikes in france disrupt transport , schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' retraite ' or retirement is a controversial issue in france french unions have staged another day of protests and strikes , bringing more than two million people onto the streets to defy president nicolas sarkozy 's plan to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 . a fresh day of strikes and protests were held across france on thursday against plans to keep french citizens working until they are 62 , rather than the current retirement age of 60 .
walkouts have hit schools and transport hardest - with only around one train in two running nationally .
fifty percent of flights at paris orly have been cancelled and 40 percent at the charles de gaulle airport and other airports across the country .
president sarkozy has said he will press on with the pension reform plans regardless .
the bill has already passed france 's lower house of parliament and will be debated next month in the upper house , the senate .
labor minister eric woerth , in charge of steering the bill through parliament , told reporters : " we have n't changed .
we are very firm on the core of the reform , which is the retirement age . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated one to three million took part in national strikes earlier this month thursday 's 24-hour industrial action is the follow up to strikes two weeks ago , where between one and three million french workers took to the streets to fight the reforms .
the unions said they expected more people on the streets for the latest round of protests .
reforming the system under current rules , french men and women can retire at 60 , but they only get a full pension if they have paid social security contributions for a given period , which for most working people is 40.5 years .
under the new law , the number of years to get a full pension is due to increase to 41.5 years and the minimum retirement age is to go up to 62 .
currently retirees can still get a full state pension , regardless of the number of years worked at age 65 .
the new law calls for this to gradually increase to 67 by 2018 .
the government argues the reform could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- by 2030 and help reduce france 's current public deficit of 8 percent of gdp .
they also say it is necessary to curb a growing deficit in the pension system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pensions issue is central to sarkozy 's reform programme " if you do n't reform it , it simply wo n't be viable and we wo n't be able to pay french people 's pensions , " labor minister woerth said .
' a battle for justice ' unions and opposition politicians say the plan puts an unfair burden on those who might struggle to meet the 41.5-year threshold - particularly women , part-timers and the former unemployed .
socialist party leader martine aubry said on wednesday : " we will throw all our force into the battle because pension reform is a battle for justice and for the republic . "
they argue that money would be better saved by the introduction of taxes on certain bonuses and the highest income bracket .

the usa , a country already at ease with enthusiastic patriotism , was marking its bicentennial with an exuberant , country-wide , year-long celebration .
kris ' town was no exception , with the locals making canvas replica flags in imitation of the first flag of the new nation , which was made in 1776 .
and his father bought one , flying it outside their modest home , for years .
kris says in america , flying a flag is often much more a decorative choice than a political statement .
eventually , his father took it down , folded it up and put it away in the basement .
years later , kris rediscovered it .
he washed it and kept it safe , later taking it with him when he moved to england .
and it now hangs , faded , tattered , and slightly stained , on the wall of his sitting room in the family home in surrey .
he says ' for me , an ex-pat now , it reminds me of a golden time in my own life , and of two special times in my country 's history . '
jefferson was the third president of the united states ' it reminds me of what the united states stood for , from its infancy , of the principles which founded it , of the pride which can be found there . '
' and it reminds my half-english children of the living history which belongs to them too , although they barely comprehend it now . '
' it binds my family 's distant past to its distant future . '
in 1775 , george washington led a colonist continental army to fight against british rule in america .
and on 4 july 1776 , thomas jefferson 's ' american declaration of independence ' was endorsed by congress .
this resulted in the colonies becoming independent and is still celebrated today as independence day .
however , it was not until 1787 when the founding fathers drew up the new constitution for united states of america , which came into effect in 1788 .
