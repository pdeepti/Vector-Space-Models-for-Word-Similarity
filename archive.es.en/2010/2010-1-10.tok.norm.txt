germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .

pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 10.01.2010 the fate of blacks in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign saying that interaction between blacks and whites degrades the race during the third reich , germany had a small black community , yet relatively little is known about their life in the nazi era .
deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .

pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

" the kohlenpott is a melting pot of peoples and cultures , " barroso said .
" the diversity in the ruhr region is now greater than ever . ” the ruhr region , home to 53 cities and 5.3 million inhabitants , was selected as the european culture capital alongside the turkish city istanbul and the hungarian town of pecs . the selection of the ruhr marks the first time a region , rather than a city , has been awarded the distinction . smh / dpa / epa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .

municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 10.01.2010 the fate of blacks in nazi germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign saying that interaction between blacks and whites degrades the race during the third reich , germany had a small black community , yet relatively little is known about their life in the nazi era .
deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .

moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .

deutsche welle takes a look at survival strategies under hitler 's oppressive regime . between 20,000 - 25,000 blacks lived in nazi germany under hitler 's rule.when asked about blacks in the third reich , germans are most likely to talk about the afrika schau .
in his book , " hitler 's black victims , " american university researcher , dr. clarence lusane writes that the africa schau was a traveling show that began in 1936 .
the show 's owners were juliette tipner , whose mother was from liberia and her white husband , adolph hillerkus .
the aim of their spectacle was to showcase african culture in germany .
in 1940 , the afrika schau was taken over by the ss and joseph goebbels who " were hoping that it would become useful not only for propaganda and ideological purposes but also as a way to gather all the blacks in the country under one tent , " writes lusane .
for blacks who joined the afrika schau , it became a means of survival in nazi germany .
duke university historian , dr. tina campt , whose research deals with the african diaspora in germany said that " it was possible that blacks who were involved in it used it for purposes that were not the intention of those who organized it .
so if the afrika schau dehumanized people , there were ways that blacks involved in it could use it as an opportunity to make money , as a site to connect to other black people , " she told deutsche welle . however , the show was unsuccessful and was shut down in 1941 .
also , it could not gather all the blacks in the country under one tent possibly because it only accepted dark-skinned blacks who appealed to the stereotype of what was considered african .
the fate of the " rhineland bastards " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-german hans j. massaquoi tried to join the nazi youth most of the light-skinned blacks living in germany during the third reich were of mixed blood , and a good number of them were the children of french-african occupation soldiers and german women in the rhineland .
the existence of these children is and remains common knowledge because they were mentioned in hitler 's book " mein kampf " -lrb- " my struggle " -rrb- . in nazi germany , the derogatory term , rheinlandbastard -lrb- rhineland bastard -rrb- , was used to describe them .
deutsche welle spoke to leading german historian prof. reiner pommerin to find out what happened to these children .
" i published a book in the 70s , which told the reader about the sterilization of mixed blood children .
these were children who had been fathered by occupation forces - mostly french occupation forces , " he said . his book , " sterilisierung der rheinlandbastarde .
das schicksal einer farbigen deutschen minderheit 1918 - 1937 " -lrb- " sterilization of the rhineland bastards : the fate of a colored german minority 1918 - 1937 " -rrb- publicized the sterilization of the black minority in nazi germany .
prior to the publication of the book in 1979 , this information was unknown to the public .
the sterilization of biracial children was carried out secretly because it went against 1938 nazi laws and procedures .
the exact numbers remain unknown , but it is estimated that 400 children of mixed blood were sterilized - most without their knowledge , pommerin said .
today , the fate of the " rhineland bastards " still remains largely unknown .
the lack of public knowledge regarding their fate may have to do with the " lack of public interest in minorities , " said pommerin . campt attributes it to the secrecy behind the sterilization program and the nature of the afrika schau .
" it has to do with the status of the afrika schau as a spectacle .
so that was set up as a visual spectacle that was supposed to get people to notice something as a display .
in that way , it was really publicized in order to get people to think about , " she said . recognition of the black experience in nazi germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afro-germans were excluded from aspects of daily life in the nazi era according to campt , the major difference between the experience of blacks and that of other groups in the third reich is the lack of a systematic nazi extermination plan .
moreover , because of the small number of blacks living in germany , few people are ready to recognize that there was even a population whose experience can be discussed .
furthermore , there is little or no support in germany for researchers working in this area .
unlike in the united states where research on minorities is well-funded due to the legacy of the civil rights movement , " black german scholars who have been doing this work for years do n't necessarily get the recognition on the basis of qualifications , on the basis of whether or not they are working within a certain kind of academic scholarly structure for the study of minority cultures , " campt said .
all the same , it should be noted that even though the publication of pommerin 's book on the sterilization of the " rhineland bastards " did not generate much public interest at the time , it received some attention from a german politician .
the member of the social democratic party asked if he could obtain the names of the victims , so that they could be compensated .
pommerin told deutsche welle that " -lrb- the politician -rrb- wanted to hand over 3,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,190 -rrb- .
i knew where they were living , but i did n't want to bother these people because i could tell that this was more a political interest .
and i could see the tv cameras standing in front of the house in the village and money is handed over .
and all of a sudden the sensation is great in the village - here is someone who had been sterilized . "

" now instead of mining coal from below the ground , we are promoting the ideas that have been resting in the minds and hearts of the people . " the title of cultural capital 2010 was a windfall for the ruhr , a former industrial powerhouse in western germany that has been struggling with severe unemployment and poverty since the collapse of the coal-mining industry . " today is a dream come true , " said prime minister of north rhine-westphalia juergen ruettgers . thousands of art and culture events are planned for the coming year and over five million visitors are expected . viewers tune in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular german singer herbert grönemeyer performed live at the open air event .

" the kohlenpott is a melting pot of peoples and cultures , " barroso said .
" the diversity in the ruhr region is now greater than ever . ” the ruhr region , home to 53 cities and 5.3 million inhabitants , was selected as the european culture capital alongside the turkish city istanbul and the hungarian town of pecs . the selection of the ruhr marks the first time a region , rather than a city , has been awarded the distinction . smh / dpa / epa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .

the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .

ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's minister of justice has chastised internet giant google over its business strategy and " lack of transparency " regarding user data . in an interview with german magazine spiegel , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said the company must clearly inform users of what is happening with their data .
" if this does not occur , then perhaps we will be required to step in as lawmakers , " she said . the minister said applications like google street view and google earth , which provide satellite images of almost everything from city streets to entire countries , are " absolutely worth exploring , " with regard to data protection .
" i am bothered by this kind of rushing forward , this megalomania , which is also apparent in the case of google book search , " she said , adding that the us-based internet business was becoming " a monopoly , similar to microsoft . "
google spokesperson kay oberbeck said it is an integral part of google 's services and product development , that " full transparency and options " are given to users .
trouble in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google was fined by a french court for scanning 4,000 books from a french publisher last month , the german government agreed to a plan that would fund the digitization of books , pictures , sculptures , notes , music and films and make them available on the internet .
the project , called the german digital library -lrb- ddb -rrb- , is expected to go online in 2011 and play a major role in the preservation of germany 's cultural identity independently of google 's book search program .
initial funding of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- as well as annual costs of 2.6 million euros will come from a german economic bail-out program and be split by the federal and state governments .
also in december , google 's attempt to digitize all of the world 's books hit a bump when a french court ruled the company had violated copyright laws .
this was based on google digitizing 4,000 books from one of france 's biggest publishing houses , la martiniere .
the court ordered google to pay 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 430,000 -rrb- in damages to three publishers owned by la mariniere as well as a symbolic sum of one euro to the sne publisher 's association and the sgdl society of authors .
google was also charged an additional 10,000 euros a day for each day the digitized books remained in its data-base .
france is considering taxing google 's ad revenues to fund creative industries hit by the digital revolution .
civic action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody wants to see a google car roaming their streets a german city opposed to google 's street view passed a law in december 2009 to charge the internet behemoth a fee for photographing its streets .
ratingen , a city on the outskirts of dusseldorf , voted through a special use fee of 20 euros for every kilometer of street travelled by google camera cars , which take the house-by-house pictures .
pressed by angry homeowners , town officials adopted the law after receiving legal advice that they had no power to stop google .
german privacy officials have declared the photography legal after google promised to skip buildings whose owners object in advance .
municipal special use fees usually apply to commercial services , such as people setting up stalls on public streets to sell fruit .
officials said ratingen has 309 kilometres of streets , so the fee for photographing all of them each time would be 6,180 euros .
they added that google had not tried to take pictures in ratingen yet , but the municipality wanted to be ready. mk / reuters / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
