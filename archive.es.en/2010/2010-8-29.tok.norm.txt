" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party . " sarrazin has claimed his views toe the party line .
other parties , he said , would prefer to see immigrants kicked out of germany , whereas he claimed to advocate integration . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population .

german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party .

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army .

" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .

but employers in the metalworking industry have rejected the call , saying there is no guarantee the good times will continue . the head of germany 's employers ' federation for the metalworking industry on sunday rejected calls by the country 's top union for a 6 percent pay hike for 85,000 workers in the sector , saying the country 's economic recovery was still shaky . " after the deepest and most brutal slump in recent economic history , the recovery is still on wobbly legs , " martin kannegiesser wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . firing the opening salvo in what is expected to be long and drawn-out pay negotiations in europe 's biggest economy , the ig metall union , germany 's largest , called on friday for an inflation-busting 6 percent rise following years of wage restraint . " employees must gain something from the recovery , " the head of ig metall union , berthold huber , told the bild am sonntag .
" higher wages are justified and sensible .
they are good for people and good for the economy . " german economy on the road to recovery germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , has enjoyed a stellar bounce after a hefty recession during the global slump . output in the second quarter of this year was 2.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago and the central bank has predicted annual growth of three percent . however , economists have said they believe the economy is set to lose some steam in the second half of the year , which will likely complicate the pay talks . in addition , inflation in germany remains tame , with recent figures showing that prices in august rose only a very moderate 1.0 percent from the same month a year ago , well below the european central bank ceiling of 2 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army . " parliament knows that it can count on the bundeswehr , " lammert told soldiers .
" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army .

this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party . " sarrazin has claimed his views toe the party line .
other parties , he said , would prefer to see immigrants kicked out of germany , whereas he claimed to advocate integration . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population .

german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party .

" russia aims to begin launching manned rockets from its new vostochny cosmodrome as early as 2018 , " said prime minister vladimir putin on saturday , august 28 , while touring the site .
the construction of the vostochny facility , putin said , was " one of the most ambitious projects in modern russia . "
he stressed the " strategic need " for the country to have a modern launch facility on its own territory .
the new space center should be ready to launch satellites and cargo rockets to the international space station in 2015 before the first manned spaceflights begin , the prime minister said .

russia currently uses the soviet-built baikonur launch facility in kazakhstan for all of its manned spaceflight and commercial missions .
a small center in northern russia is used for military satellite launches .
russia has been leasing the baikonur site from kazakhstan , since the break-up of the soviet union , for 90 million euros a year .
the lease expires in 2050 .
the new vostochny launch site is located 5,800 kilometers -lrb- 3,600 miles -rrb- east of moscow and barely a hundred kilometers north of the chinese border .

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .

the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

" higher wages are justified and sensible .
they are good for people and good for the economy . " german economy on the road to recovery germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , has enjoyed a stellar bounce after a hefty recession during the global slump . output in the second quarter of this year was 2.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago and the central bank has predicted annual growth of three percent . however , economists have said they believe the economy is set to lose some steam in the second half of the year , which will likely complicate the pay talks . in addition , inflation in germany remains tame , with recent figures showing that prices in august rose only a very moderate 1.0 percent from the same month a year ago , well below the european central bank ceiling of 2 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party .

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population .

german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos .

but employers in the metalworking industry have rejected the call , saying there is no guarantee the good times will continue . the head of germany 's employers ' federation for the metalworking industry on sunday rejected calls by the country 's top union for a 6 percent pay hike for 85,000 workers in the sector , saying the country 's economic recovery was still shaky . " after the deepest and most brutal slump in recent economic history , the recovery is still on wobbly legs , " martin kannegiesser wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . firing the opening salvo in what is expected to be long and drawn-out pay negotiations in europe 's biggest economy , the ig metall union , germany 's largest , called on friday for an inflation-busting 6 percent rise following years of wage restraint . " employees must gain something from the recovery , " the head of ig metall union , berthold huber , told the bild am sonntag .
" higher wages are justified and sensible .
they are good for people and good for the economy . " german economy on the road to recovery germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , has enjoyed a stellar bounce after a hefty recession during the global slump . output in the second quarter of this year was 2.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago and the central bank has predicted annual growth of three percent . however , economists have said they believe the economy is set to lose some steam in the second half of the year , which will likely complicate the pay talks . in addition , inflation in germany remains tame , with recent figures showing that prices in august rose only a very moderate 1.0 percent from the same month a year ago , well below the european central bank ceiling of 2 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

" a trial period is conceivable , " he told the newspaper .

this could include a salary , pension or educational opportunities , he said . the interview was published while guttenberg was paying a surprise visit to german troops in the baghlan province of afghanistan . it was the fifth time the defense minister has visited troops in the 10 months since he took office , but the first visit by a senior politician to german soldiers in a combat zone . " it is so important that one judges the facts not only from one 's desk , but also looks at the realities in the place where the fighting is taking place , " guttenberg said . he emphasized his support for the troops ' efforts , but would n't comment on a possible date for the withdrawal of german soldiers from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending conscription affects more than just the army , one politician said proud tradition the idea of ending germany 's long-standing tradition of mandatory military service has not been without criticism .

" this is not something we can sacrifice easily , " he said . but guttenberg said only a small percentage of german men were actually called on to perform mandatory service . " today when it 's possible for anyone can say , ' i do n't want to serve so i 'm not going , ' then we have a de facto voluntary army already , " he told the paper , adding that only 13 to 16 percent of men are drafted into temporary service . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa / apn -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army . " parliament knows that it can count on the bundeswehr , " lammert told soldiers .
" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party . " sarrazin has claimed his views toe the party line .
other parties , he said , would prefer to see immigrants kicked out of germany , whereas he claimed to advocate integration . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population .

german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party .

" a trial period is conceivable , " he told the newspaper .

this could include a salary , pension or educational opportunities , he said . the interview was published while guttenberg was paying a surprise visit to german troops in the baghlan province of afghanistan . it was the fifth time the defense minister has visited troops in the 10 months since he took office , but the first visit by a senior politician to german soldiers in a combat zone . " it is so important that one judges the facts not only from one 's desk , but also looks at the realities in the place where the fighting is taking place , " guttenberg said . he emphasized his support for the troops ' efforts , but would n't comment on a possible date for the withdrawal of german soldiers from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending conscription affects more than just the army , one politician said proud tradition the idea of ending germany 's long-standing tradition of mandatory military service has not been without criticism .

" this is not something we can sacrifice easily , " he said . but guttenberg said only a small percentage of german men were actually called on to perform mandatory service . " today when it 's possible for anyone can say , ' i do n't want to serve so i 'm not going , ' then we have a de facto voluntary army already , " he told the paper , adding that only 13 to 16 percent of men are drafted into temporary service . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa / apn -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army .

" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia aims to begin launching manned rockets from its new vostochny cosmodrome as early as 2018 , " said prime minister vladimir putin on saturday , august 28 , while touring the site .
the construction of the vostochny facility , putin said , was " one of the most ambitious projects in modern russia . "
he stressed the " strategic need " for the country to have a modern launch facility on its own territory .
the new space center should be ready to launch satellites and cargo rockets to the international space station in 2015 before the first manned spaceflights begin , the prime minister said .

russia currently uses the soviet-built baikonur launch facility in kazakhstan for all of its manned spaceflight and commercial missions .
a small center in northern russia is used for military satellite launches .
russia has been leasing the baikonur site from kazakhstan , since the break-up of the soviet union , for 90 million euros a year .
the lease expires in 2050 .
the new vostochny launch site is located 5,800 kilometers -lrb- 3,600 miles -rrb- east of moscow and barely a hundred kilometers north of the chinese border .

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army . " parliament knows that it can count on the bundeswehr , " lammert told soldiers .
" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could include a salary , pension or educational opportunities , he said . the interview was published while guttenberg was paying a surprise visit to german troops in the baghlan province of afghanistan . it was the fifth time the defense minister has visited troops in the 10 months since he took office , but the first visit by a senior politician to german soldiers in a combat zone . " it is so important that one judges the facts not only from one 's desk , but also looks at the realities in the place where the fighting is taking place , " guttenberg said . he emphasized his support for the troops ' efforts , but would n't comment on a possible date for the withdrawal of german soldiers from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending conscription affects more than just the army , one politician said proud tradition the idea of ending germany 's long-standing tradition of mandatory military service has not been without criticism .

" this is not something we can sacrifice easily , " he said . but guttenberg said only a small percentage of german men were actually called on to perform mandatory service . " today when it 's possible for anyone can say , ' i do n't want to serve so i 'm not going , ' then we have a de facto voluntary army already , " he told the paper , adding that only 13 to 16 percent of men are drafted into temporary service . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa / apn -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .

but employers in the metalworking industry have rejected the call , saying there is no guarantee the good times will continue . the head of germany 's employers ' federation for the metalworking industry on sunday rejected calls by the country 's top union for a 6 percent pay hike for 85,000 workers in the sector , saying the country 's economic recovery was still shaky .

" employees must gain something from the recovery , " the head of ig metall union , berthold huber , told the bild am sonntag .
" higher wages are justified and sensible .
they are good for people and good for the economy . " german economy on the road to recovery germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , has enjoyed a stellar bounce after a hefty recession during the global slump . output in the second quarter of this year was 2.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago and the central bank has predicted annual growth of three percent . however , economists have said they believe the economy is set to lose some steam in the second half of the year , which will likely complicate the pay talks . in addition , inflation in germany remains tame , with recent figures showing that prices in august rose only a very moderate 1.0 percent from the same month a year ago , well below the european central bank ceiling of 2 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party .

but employers in the metalworking industry have rejected the call , saying there is no guarantee the good times will continue . the head of germany 's employers ' federation for the metalworking industry on sunday rejected calls by the country 's top union for a 6 percent pay hike for 85,000 workers in the sector , saying the country 's economic recovery was still shaky . " after the deepest and most brutal slump in recent economic history , the recovery is still on wobbly legs , " martin kannegiesser wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . firing the opening salvo in what is expected to be long and drawn-out pay negotiations in europe 's biggest economy , the ig metall union , germany 's largest , called on friday for an inflation-busting 6 percent rise following years of wage restraint . " employees must gain something from the recovery , " the head of ig metall union , berthold huber , told the bild am sonntag .
" higher wages are justified and sensible .
they are good for people and good for the economy . " german economy on the road to recovery germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , has enjoyed a stellar bounce after a hefty recession during the global slump . output in the second quarter of this year was 2.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago and the central bank has predicted annual growth of three percent . however , economists have said they believe the economy is set to lose some steam in the second half of the year , which will likely complicate the pay talks . in addition , inflation in germany remains tame , with recent figures showing that prices in august rose only a very moderate 1.0 percent from the same month a year ago , well below the european central bank ceiling of 2 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german central bank executive thilo sarrazin has stirred fresh controversy over the weekend with discriminatory remarks concerning religious minorities . " all jews share a particular gene , " sarrazin said in an interview published on sunday .
" that makes them different from other peoples . " sarrazin , who is currently promoting his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , remained undeterred in expressing his views despite criticism and calls for his resignation from the board of the bundesbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says muslims in germany do not contribute to the economy " the cultural peculiarities of the peoples is no myth , but determines the reality of europe , " sarrazin told the newspapers welt am sonntag and berliner morgenpost . berlin 's former finance chief has said in the past that muslims living in germany do not contribute to the country 's economic prosperity , reducing their role to the running of fruit and vegetable stands . he reiterated his view that muslim immigrants all over europe were integrating more poorly than other immigrant populations into the societies of their host countries . in 2009 , the central banker , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , had said he would prefer immigration " if it was by eastern european jews with a 15-percent-higher iq than the german population . " wide criticism the jewish community in germany reacted with indignation to sarrazin 's attempts at racial profiling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book claims that immigration is a threat to germany " whoever tries to define jews by their genetic makeup , even when it is superficially positive in tone , is in the grip of a race mania that jews do not share , " said stephan kramer , secretary of the central council of jews in germany .
german chancellor angela merkel weighed in on sarrizin 's comments in an interview on ard television , saying his remarks were " completely unacceptable " and " run down entire groups of society . "
merkel added that she was sure sarrizin 's remarks would be discussed within the bundesbank .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also responded to sarrazin 's latest comments .
he said statements " that promote racism or anti-semitism have no place in political discourse . "
while sarrazin made reference in his interview to the alleged unique genetics of social groups , he also claimed he was not racist .
it was not ethnicity , he said , but rather the culture of islam that kept muslims immigrants from integrating into european societies . radical speech roland koch , the outgoing premier of the german state of hesse , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that sarrazin was pushing himself into the margins of politics .
koch recognized that the banker was " addressing existing problems that society must n't ignore , " but added that he obviously appeared to be concerned only with pursuing " radical speech and the breaching of taboos . " before sarrazin 's latest statements were published , the chairman of germany 's turkish federation had called for sarrazin to be removed from his post .
meanwhile , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel and germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer expressed outrage at sarrazin 's statements . christian gaebler of the spd told news magazine spiegel that if sarrazin did not willingly leave the party , he and other members would " begin procedures to expel him from the party . " sarrazin has claimed his views toe the party line .
other parties , he said , would prefer to see immigrants kicked out of germany , whereas he claimed to advocate integration . author : david levitz -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to demonstrate with our visit that the parliament stands behind the bundeswehr , " lammert said . lammert presented the soldiers with a flag that had flown over the parliament in berlin , saying it should be a symbol of the connection between the bundestag and the bundeswehr army . " parliament knows that it can count on the bundeswehr , " lammert told soldiers .
" you should know that you can count on parliament . " no glamorous picture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg wants to reduce the german military by at least 70,000 meanwhile , in an interview for the newspaper bild am sonntag , the defense minister , who is planning to revamp the armed forces , said he would paint " no glamorous picture " of the country 's military . " today , with 252,000 soldiers , we can make available a total of not more than 7,000 for international campaigns , " said guttenberg , who has visited afghanistan five times since assuming his post last october . the minister has advocated slashing germany 's troop levels to a maximum of 180,000 soldiers .
this reflects " not the state of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- funds , but rather the demography , " guttenberg said , citing germany 's shrinking population . critics have said that a reduction of the bundeswehr 's size would be solely motivated by budgetary constrictions and would limit the military 's ability to train soldiers . the bundestag in february extended germany 's military engagement in afghanistan and increased the upper limit of german troops authorized to serve there from 4,500 to 5,350 .
there are currently around 4,600 german soldiers on assignment in the country with that number expected to rise to 5,000 by the year 's end . author : david levitz -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fritz said , for example , that the classified documents contained the names of ordinary afghans working with isaf .
" i believe this action is absolutely irresponsible , " he said .
" it endangers the life and limb not only of our german soldiers , but of all soldiers who are deployed in afghanistan . " general fritz made his remarks alongside german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and the speaker of the german parliament , norbert lammert , who gave a press conference after their arrival in mazar-i-sharif , afghanistan , to visit german troops .
the afghan mission is currently germany 's largest deployment of armed forces abroad with up to 5,350 personnel authorized to serve in the country .
bildunterschrift : " actions absolutely irresponsible , " says german general about leaked documents a battle between david and goliath washington has harshly criticized wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , but has not yet said whether or not it will take legal , or other , action against the tiny handful of people who work for the website .
the pentagon suspects an us army private based in iraq was the source of the military documents .
wikileaks , which is not connected to the popular online encyclopedia wikipedia , has refused to return any of the material and said it has 15,000 more documents , which it planned to publish later this year .
the website is based in sweden , whose media laws are among the most protective for journalists .
the choice of sweden gives wikileaks a better shot at fulfilling its mission to make the world more transparent because it will be hard for the us government to challenge the country 's free-speech laws .
per eric alvsing , a stockholm lawyer , said that an informant 's identity is protected by the swedish constitution , but that anything considered libelous or related to national security could allow for exceptions .
