the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .

the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.12.2010 immigration debate sparks year-long controversy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multi-ethnic german national team , with stars such as mesut oezil , inspired fans the challenge of integrating immigrants , especially muslims , dominated german media throughout the year .
emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .

however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .

emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "

the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

israel has yet to approve the deal .
" we want to both preserve relations and defend our rights , " davutoglu said , adding that " nothing can cover up " the killing of turkish citizens .
" if our friendship with israel is going to continue , an apology and compensation are the only possible outcome , " he said .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de genetics -pipe- 26.12.2010 german christians attack embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of pid is highly divisive within germany religious leaders in germany have spoken out against recent moves by parliamentarians to force a relaxation of laws on the genetic screening of embryos as part of in vitro fertilization . germany 's religious leaders have weighed into the controversial debate over pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- , which allows doctors to screen embryo cells for genetic defects before they are implanted in the womb .
the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.12.2010 survey finds half of germans want deutschmark back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans would happily swap their euros for deutschmarks a survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild has found that many germans are unhappy with how the common european currency has worked out and would gladly go back to the good old deutschmark . it 's been a tough year for the euro , with debt crises in some eurozone countries chipping away at the common european currency 's value .
many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.12.2010 portuguese turn to food banks in time of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever more portuguese are turning to food banks for help portugal is being forced to make spending cuts in order to reduce the national deficit , and very few remain unaffected .
even some middle class citizens , such as doctors and lawyers , are having to ask for help to get by . at a storage facility of the lisbon food bank , there is hardly a free moment for the volunteers stacking pallets of food and labelling them for distribution .
canned goods that are nearing their expiration date , potato chips that are sold in different packaging , or lettuce that did n't find a buyer at the market - all of these things end up at the food bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonet has noticed more middle class citizens asking for help rather than handing out food to those in need directly , the food bank doles out food to various aid organizations , such as the red cross , for local distribution .
" the food bank collects excess supplies from the food and agricultural industries that would otherwise be destroyed , " isabel jonet , the founder and director of the food bank in lisbon said .
" there are currently 18 food banks in portugal serving 1,830 organizations .
these organizations ensure that 280,000 people get at least one warm meal a day . "
however , the volunteers at the food bank in lisbon have had a tough time keeping up with the demand recently as portugal 's budget crisis worsens .
more and more people have been going hungry .
europe 's poorhouse that 's no surprise considering some of what some people live off of in portugal .
around a million pensioners have to get by on less than 300 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- per month , and the average income is around 800 euros per month .
on top of that , unemployment is skyrocketing at a time when the portuguese government is being forced to reduce spending .
as a result , many social programs have been severely cut .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese food banks service nearly 2,000 aid organizations " the costs of the crisis are being unevenly distributed and hit the unemployed the hardest , " said sociologist jose maria castro caldas .
" that is at least 10 percent of the population .
and if unemployment funds are cut now , about 600,000 portuguese will have more or less no security through social programs . "
the middle class is n't immune to these cuts either .
taxes are also rising , and more and more professors , bankers , and lawyers are slipping below the poverty line through no fault of their own .
" many middle class citizens have lost their jobs and are in a tough spot , " said food bank director isabel jonet .
" they do n't see any chance of finding another job .
teachers , doctors , and university staff have financial difficulties and are coming to us for help . "
no relief in sight economists and politicians agree that things in portugal will only get worse in the foreseeable future .
for that reason , many portuguese are leaving the country .
exact figures are not available , but many emigrants are young people who go abroad in search of work .
margarida paes is a married mother of two in her mid-20s .
her family is toying with the idea of leaving portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paes said she would move with her family if she could " if my husband or i got a good job offer , of course we 'd leave ! " she said .
paes works on a freelance basis in a law office for 500 euros a month ; her husband earns about twice that amount .
she says it 's difficult sometimes for the family of four to make ends meet . when their income is n't enough , they have to rely on help from their families .
child subsidy money has also been cut , and that surely wo n't be the last thing to go from portugal 's budget either .
the european union is pressuring the country to save even more to bring its debt problem under control , which can only spell even harder times for the portuguese people down the road .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.12.2010 portuguese turn to food banks in time of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever more portuguese are turning to food banks for help portugal is being forced to make spending cuts in order to reduce the national deficit , and very few remain unaffected .
even some middle class citizens , such as doctors and lawyers , are having to ask for help to get by . at a storage facility of the lisbon food bank , there is hardly a free moment for the volunteers stacking pallets of food and labelling them for distribution .
canned goods that are nearing their expiration date , potato chips that are sold in different packaging , or lettuce that did n't find a buyer at the market - all of these things end up at the food bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonet has noticed more middle class citizens asking for help rather than handing out food to those in need directly , the food bank doles out food to various aid organizations , such as the red cross , for local distribution .
" the food bank collects excess supplies from the food and agricultural industries that would otherwise be destroyed , " isabel jonet , the founder and director of the food bank in lisbon said .
" there are currently 18 food banks in portugal serving 1,830 organizations .
these organizations ensure that 280,000 people get at least one warm meal a day . "
however , the volunteers at the food bank in lisbon have had a tough time keeping up with the demand recently as portugal 's budget crisis worsens .
more and more people have been going hungry .
europe 's poorhouse that 's no surprise considering some of what some people live off of in portugal .
around a million pensioners have to get by on less than 300 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- per month , and the average income is around 800 euros per month .
on top of that , unemployment is skyrocketing at a time when the portuguese government is being forced to reduce spending .
as a result , many social programs have been severely cut .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese food banks service nearly 2,000 aid organizations " the costs of the crisis are being unevenly distributed and hit the unemployed the hardest , " said sociologist jose maria castro caldas .
" that is at least 10 percent of the population .
and if unemployment funds are cut now , about 600,000 portuguese will have more or less no security through social programs . "
the middle class is n't immune to these cuts either .
taxes are also rising , and more and more professors , bankers , and lawyers are slipping below the poverty line through no fault of their own .
" many middle class citizens have lost their jobs and are in a tough spot , " said food bank director isabel jonet .
" they do n't see any chance of finding another job .
teachers , doctors , and university staff have financial difficulties and are coming to us for help . "
no relief in sight economists and politicians agree that things in portugal will only get worse in the foreseeable future .
for that reason , many portuguese are leaving the country .
exact figures are not available , but many emigrants are young people who go abroad in search of work .
margarida paes is a married mother of two in her mid-20s .
her family is toying with the idea of leaving portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paes said she would move with her family if she could " if my husband or i got a good job offer , of course we 'd leave ! " she said .
paes works on a freelance basis in a law office for 500 euros a month ; her husband earns about twice that amount .
she says it 's difficult sometimes for the family of four to make ends meet . when their income is n't enough , they have to rely on help from their families .
child subsidy money has also been cut , and that surely wo n't be the last thing to go from portugal 's budget either .
the european union is pressuring the country to save even more to bring its debt problem under control , which can only spell even harder times for the portuguese people down the road .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

" the mandate must include the beginning of a withdrawal in order for the social democrats to give their approval , " steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that such a stipulation was " a question of credibility . " " the beginning of a withdrawal of german soldiers is already specified in the 2010 afghanistan mandate , " the opposition leader said . " this must be underpinned in 2011 by concrete actions .
actions speak louder than words .

" there is absolutely no question that this mission in afghanistan is dangerous and we have many victims to mourn .
the government needs to expend less energy on media relations and more energy on preparing for an end to the mission , " the former foreign minister said . germany currently has around 4,800 troops stationed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the bundeswehr deployment remains deeply unpopular in germany . spd rising , steinmeier says steinmeier also addressed the ongoing poll troubles of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , saying there was a good chance the spd would gain the upper hand on the cdu in the new year . " we are moving into the new year with a lot of momentum and have the goal of making the spd the strongest political force in germany once again , " he said , adding that an spd partnership with the greens would garner more public support than the current government coalition between the cdu and liberal free democrats . " we want to win elections , " steinmeier said .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.12.2010 immigration debate sparks year-long controversy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multi-ethnic german national team , with stars such as mesut oezil , inspired fans the challenge of integrating immigrants , especially muslims , dominated german media throughout the year .
emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de genetics -pipe- 26.12.2010 german christians attack embryo screening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the issue of pid is highly divisive within germany religious leaders in germany have spoken out against recent moves by parliamentarians to force a relaxation of laws on the genetic screening of embryos as part of in vitro fertilization . germany 's religious leaders have weighed into the controversial debate over pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- , which allows doctors to screen embryo cells for genetic defects before they are implanted in the womb .
the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "

the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

" the mandate must include the beginning of a withdrawal in order for the social democrats to give their approval , " steinmeier told the bild am sonntag newspaper , adding that such a stipulation was " a question of credibility . " " the beginning of a withdrawal of german soldiers is already specified in the 2010 afghanistan mandate , " the opposition leader said . " this must be underpinned in 2011 by concrete actions .
actions speak louder than words . " what ’ s in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the spd has turned over a new leaf steinmeier went on to criticize chancellor angela merkel for using the word " war " to describe the situation in afghanistan during her latest visit to the country . german politicians have traditionally specified that the bundeswehr is involved in an " armed conflict " rather than an all-out war . " there is absolutely no question that this mission in afghanistan is dangerous and we have many victims to mourn .
the government needs to expend less energy on media relations and more energy on preparing for an end to the mission , " the former foreign minister said . germany currently has around 4,800 troops stationed in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the bundeswehr deployment remains deeply unpopular in germany . spd rising , steinmeier says steinmeier also addressed the ongoing poll troubles of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , saying there was a good chance the spd would gain the upper hand on the cdu in the new year . " we are moving into the new year with a lot of momentum and have the goal of making the spd the strongest political force in germany once again , " he said , adding that an spd partnership with the greens would garner more public support than the current government coalition between the cdu and liberal free democrats . " we want to win elections , " steinmeier said .

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.12.2010 immigration debate sparks year-long controversy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multi-ethnic german national team , with stars such as mesut oezil , inspired fans the challenge of integrating immigrants , especially muslims , dominated german media throughout the year .
emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "

breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "

however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.12.2010 immigration debate sparks year-long controversy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multi-ethnic german national team , with stars such as mesut oezil , inspired fans the challenge of integrating immigrants , especially muslims , dominated german media throughout the year .
emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "
a january report by germany 's federal statistics office revealed some of the obstacles facing immigrants .
the office found that 14.2 % of immigrants in germany have no school leaving certificate , compared to just 1.8 % of all germans .
44.3 % of immigrants have no professional qualification , while 19.9 % of germans are in the same situation .
and 12.4 % of immigrants between the ages of 25 and 65 are unemployed — about twice the rate of their german counterparts .
language the key to professional success integration minister maria boehmer , meanwhile , has emphasized the importance of learning the german language .
she said , whoever wants to be as successful as mesut oezil or his teammate sami khedira , the son of a native german and a tunisian , must master the language of the country where he lives .
only then could migrants take advantage of the opportunities their adopted country offers them .
" if you do not speak the german language in this county , " boehmer said , " then you are just a visitor here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff envisions an inclusive germany the next turn in the integration debate came from german president christian wulff .
before he took office , he had promised to put the topic at the top of his agenda .
elected in june , wulff 's first major speech came on october 3 , the 20th anniversary of germany 's reunification .
" christianity undoubtedly belongs in germany , " he said . " judaism undoubtedly belongs in germany .
that is our judaeo-christian history .
but now , islam also belongs in germany . "
wulff 's proclamation came during a time of economic uncertainty in germany .
the country 's export-oriented economy eventually recovered from the global economic crisis , in the last fiscal quarter of 2010 , and a surge in demand for german high quality goods allowed companies to start hiring again .
however , this raised concern over a shortage of skilled workers .
germany 's economics minister rainer bruederle , labor minister ursula von der leyen , and education minister annette schavan spoke out in favor of relaxing rules for foreign workers to come to germany .
the idea met with vehement opposition from horst seehofer , leader of the conservative christian social union in chancellor angela merkel 's government .
seehofer called for an end to the inflow of immigrants from other cultures , saying training for unemployed people should be given absolute priority over immigration .
he made a provocative proclamation of his own at a party meeting in october .
" multiculturalism is dead , " seehofer said .
" our party is taking a stand for german culture and against multiculturalism . "
immigrants moving forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have urged immigrants to learn german for people with immigrant backgrounds , the year was filled with both expressions of support and criticism .
however , a positive year-end note came in the form of an international study comparing schoolchildren 's abilities . the study showed remarkable progress in germany over the last ten years .
the organization for economic cooperation and development 's program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- found that the vast majority of germany 's lowest scoring students come from less wealthy families , families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
and while the performance gap in germany is still greater than in most pisa participants , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
that suggests people with immigrant backgrounds in germany are catching up with their counterparts around the world .

emotions were high as public figures offered widely different opinions . at this summer 's fifa world cup in south africa , the german team 's line-up embodied the changing character of germany . during a june public viewing in berlin , germany 's minister for integration maria boehmer told the audience made up of young immigrants and non-immigrants how impressed she was that 11 of the squad 's 23 members were either born outside germany , or had immigrant parents .
" that 's why i found it so important , " boehmer said , " when mesut oezil declared he was playing for germany .
that was a crucial decision .
and i think that many people who grew up here should make the same choice . "
that group is likely to have a significant impact on germany 's future .
a january publication by germany 's federal statistics office showed that in 2008 , one in five of the country 's 82 million inhabitants had a migration immigration background .
breaking that figure down , there were 7.3 million immigrants of non-german descent and 8.3 million people who had german citizenship , but either came from outside germany or had at least one parent who did .
people of mixed parentage represent a growing group in germany .
most immigrants to germany came from elsewhere in europe .
among those who did not , turks topped the list , numbering almost three million in 2008 .
the federal statistics office also found that people with immigrant backgrounds tend to be younger than native germans , with average ages of 34 and 45-years-old , respectively .
controversial remarks just weeks after the euphoria surrounding the young , multicultural german team at the world cup , german discussion about integration took a different turn .
top german banker thilo sarrazin published a controversial book called " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- germany is doing away with itself -rrb- in late august .
claiming to defend german identity , sarrazin depicted immigrants as unwilling to integrate .
sarrazin already had a reputation for rude remarks about unemployed people and immigrants before the book came out , and had called for higher barriers to immigration .
in his book , he wrote that turks and arabs were intellectually inferior , and claimed jews possessed a gene that made them different from other people .
during the furor that followed , german 's central bank , the bundesbank , asked sarrazin to resign from his position on its board , and he eventually did so .
the opposition social democrats also began proceedings to kick him out of the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book sparked fierce debate sarrazin saw large differences between foreigners already living in germany , especially in terms of their education .
" integration problems last no more than a generation , " he wrote , " for immigrants from eastern europe , india , china or vietnam . "
after that , those groups pursued education and competed on the job market better than germans .
yet sarrazin left the country 's more than four million muslims out of his praise .
his sweeping claims about muslim immigrants drew numerous objections .
the opposition included ayguel oezkan , minister for integration in the german state of lower saxony , who has a turkish background herself .
she said it was important to analyze migrants ' problems .
but she also said it was unacceptable to do so in " a contemptuous manner , in which you take groups such as turks and arabs and put them in a corner without appreciating what they have done — both in the first generation , and on a regular basis to this day . "

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 26.12.2010 thousands flee ivory coast post-election unrest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some ivorians still support gbagbo , despite international condemnation the united nations says refugees are fleeing ivory coast in their thousands as tensions continue to rise in the west african country following disputed elections last month . concerns that open conflict may erupt in ivory coast continue to rise as the un says it has registered some 14,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring liberia following the post-election violence in their country .
ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .

as a result , many social programs have been severely cut .

israel has to date not apologized for the incident , which killed nine turkish citizens . turkey 's foreign minister has said his country wants to improve ties with israel , but only once the jewish state apologizes for the deadly assault on a gaza-bound aid ship in may .
" we have a wish to reconcile with israel , ” ahmet davutoglu told reporters on saturday , december 25 . “ we desire peaceful relations with all countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the may raid sparked worldwide protests the minister criticized the israeli government for not reciprocating turkish overtures and its failure to apologize for the may 31 assault which left nine turks dead .
the countries held talks earlier this month in geneva and drafted a deal which would have israel apologize for the raid , compensate the victims ' families and see the turkish ambassador return to tel aviv .
israel has yet to approve the deal .
" we want to both preserve relations and defend our rights , " davutoglu said , adding that " nothing can cover up " the killing of turkish citizens .
" if our friendship with israel is going to continue , an apology and compensation are the only possible outcome , " he said .
relations were already strained before the raid , with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's frequent outbursts against the jewish state and his defense of the radical palestinian group hamas .
the raided turkish ship , mavi marmara , is due to return to istanbul on sunday , to be welcomed by pro-islamic groups .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

the bundeswehr deployment remains deeply unpopular in germany . spd rising , steinmeier says steinmeier also addressed the ongoing poll troubles of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , saying there was a good chance the spd would gain the upper hand on the cdu in the new year . " we are moving into the new year with a lot of momentum and have the goal of making the spd the strongest political force in germany once again , " he said , adding that an spd partnership with the greens would garner more public support than the current government coalition between the cdu and liberal free democrats .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .

many fiscally disciplined germans were frustrated to see their taxes going to bail out greece and ireland , whose governments ' debts had threatened to bring the euro down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the past year has seen increasing pressure on the single currency for that reason , it seems that many germans look fondly back to the days of the deutschmark , once one of the world 's most stable currencies .
german daily bild commissioned a survey by cologne 's yougov-institute that found that 49 percent of germans want the deutschmark back .
only 41 percent of those surveyed do n't .
the survey also found that the majority of germans are worried about the stability of the euro and the possibility of inflation .
some 77 percent of the 1,068 people questioned by yougov said they personally had not profited from the adoption of the euro .
would they adopt the euro today ?
if the country were currently not part of the eurozone , only 30 percent of those asked would today vote to adopt the euro and 60 percent would vote against such a move .
yet despite the respondents ' concerns , the majority believes the euro is here to stay .
asked whether the euro would still be country 's currency in 20 years , 55 percent of the respondents said yes .
germany adopted the euro in 1999 along with 10 other countries .
greece signed on in 2001 and euro bills and coins were introduced in 2002 .
since then slovenia , cyprus , malta and slovakia have joined as well .
on january 1 , estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area .

canned goods that are nearing their expiration date , potato chips that are sold in different packaging , or lettuce that did n't find a buyer at the market - all of these things end up at the food bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonet has noticed more middle class citizens asking for help rather than handing out food to those in need directly , the food bank doles out food to various aid organizations , such as the red cross , for local distribution .
" the food bank collects excess supplies from the food and agricultural industries that would otherwise be destroyed , " isabel jonet , the founder and director of the food bank in lisbon said .
" there are currently 18 food banks in portugal serving 1,830 organizations .
these organizations ensure that 280,000 people get at least one warm meal a day . "

the middle class is n't immune to these cuts either .

child subsidy money has also been cut , and that surely wo n't be the last thing to go from portugal 's budget either .
the european union is pressuring the country to save even more to bring its debt problem under control , which can only spell even harder times for the portuguese people down the road .

ivory coast , which suffered under a bloody civil war in 2002-03 , has been on edge since the disputed presidential election on november 28 .
much of the world , including the united nations , has recognized challenger alassane ouattara as the legitimate winner , but the recalcitrant strongman laurent gbagbo has refused to relinquish power despite mounting calls for him to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forces loyal to ouattara and gbagbo have clashed in the streets the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and that security forces loyal to gbagbo were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .
" refugees are coming from western -lsb- ivory coast -rsb- and unhcr staff on the ground say the refugees are having to walk several hours or even days before crossing … the natural border between their country and liberia , " the statement said .
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet … some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the un agency said .
" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .
food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance . "
the unhcr added that it was witnessing instances of malnourished children and people suffering from malaria , respiratory infections and diarrhea .
regional pressure ramped up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have been deployed to guard rallies and streets leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped pressure on gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

the process requires cells to be removed and examined for abnormalities a few days after in vitro fertilization .
if genetic defects which would burden a child with a severe impediment are detected the embryo is simply abandoned , otherwise it is deemed suitable for implantation in the womb .
german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

german lutheran bishop johannes friedrich spoke out against pid in his christmas sermon , saying that " god knows us before we are born , and holds us in his hands right up until our last breath . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says pid would not make us happier he said that , according to the church , life began with the fusion of seed and ovum , and that selection of those who lived and died was the domain of god , not mankind .
friedrich said christians could not accept the approval of pid , which " avowedly has selection as its aim . "
the outcry comes less than a week after a cross-party group of parliamentarians called for a relaxation of germany 's strict laws on pid , and published a draft bill calling for amendments to current laws on ' test-tube ' pregnancies , which was passed in 1991 , before pid was available .
pid would make us ' less human ' catholic archbishop robert zollitsch , who chairs the german episcopal conference , warned in his christmas sermon of the danger of " breaching the dam " if pid was allowed under certain circumstances .
he reminded catholics that life was a gift from god : " we are not masters of life and death , and also not over who may be born and who not .
our society would not become happier , but instead less human . "
zollitsch also said that allowing pid could lead to social pressure on individuals to turn their back on people with disabilities .
in july , the german federal court of justice ruled that pid was legal if it was intended to rule out the chance a test-tube baby could be born with a serious handicap .
pid is currently available in a handful of european countries , such as france .
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is due to decide next year on whether the practice will be allowed under certain circumstances or completely forbidden .
supporters and opponents can be found in all of germany 's major parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.12.2010 portuguese turn to food banks in time of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ever more portuguese are turning to food banks for help portugal is being forced to make spending cuts in order to reduce the national deficit , and very few remain unaffected .
even some middle class citizens , such as doctors and lawyers , are having to ask for help to get by . at a storage facility of the lisbon food bank , there is hardly a free moment for the volunteers stacking pallets of food and labelling them for distribution .
canned goods that are nearing their expiration date , potato chips that are sold in different packaging , or lettuce that did n't find a buyer at the market - all of these things end up at the food bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonet has noticed more middle class citizens asking for help rather than handing out food to those in need directly , the food bank doles out food to various aid organizations , such as the red cross , for local distribution .
" the food bank collects excess supplies from the food and agricultural industries that would otherwise be destroyed , " isabel jonet , the founder and director of the food bank in lisbon said .
" there are currently 18 food banks in portugal serving 1,830 organizations .
these organizations ensure that 280,000 people get at least one warm meal a day . "
however , the volunteers at the food bank in lisbon have had a tough time keeping up with the demand recently as portugal 's budget crisis worsens .
more and more people have been going hungry .
europe 's poorhouse that 's no surprise considering some of what some people live off of in portugal .
around a million pensioners have to get by on less than 300 euros -lrb- $ 393 -rrb- per month , and the average income is around 800 euros per month .
on top of that , unemployment is skyrocketing at a time when the portuguese government is being forced to reduce spending .
as a result , many social programs have been severely cut .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese food banks service nearly 2,000 aid organizations " the costs of the crisis are being unevenly distributed and hit the unemployed the hardest , " said sociologist jose maria castro caldas .
" that is at least 10 percent of the population .
and if unemployment funds are cut now , about 600,000 portuguese will have more or less no security through social programs . "
the middle class is n't immune to these cuts either .
taxes are also rising , and more and more professors , bankers , and lawyers are slipping below the poverty line through no fault of their own .
" many middle class citizens have lost their jobs and are in a tough spot , " said food bank director isabel jonet .
" they do n't see any chance of finding another job .
teachers , doctors , and university staff have financial difficulties and are coming to us for help . "
no relief in sight economists and politicians agree that things in portugal will only get worse in the foreseeable future .
for that reason , many portuguese are leaving the country .
exact figures are not available , but many emigrants are young people who go abroad in search of work .
margarida paes is a married mother of two in her mid-20s .
her family is toying with the idea of leaving portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paes said she would move with her family if she could " if my husband or i got a good job offer , of course we 'd leave ! " she said .
paes works on a freelance basis in a law office for 500 euros a month ; her husband earns about twice that amount .
she says it 's difficult sometimes for the family of four to make ends meet . when their income is n't enough , they have to rely on help from their families .
child subsidy money has also been cut , and that surely wo n't be the last thing to go from portugal 's budget either .
the european union is pressuring the country to save even more to bring its debt problem under control , which can only spell even harder times for the portuguese people down the road .

"
" the humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them , " the un human rights council -lrb- unhcr -rrb- said in a statement on its website , adding that the number of refugees was growing by the day .

" the growing number of new arrivals is impacting communities hosting the refugees .

the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the post-election deaths and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity . ”
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .
