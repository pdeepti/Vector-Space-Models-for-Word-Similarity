the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .

the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .

sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .

no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unions -pipe- 27.10.2010 do german workers deserve a pay hike ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch is giving workers a pay hike two months earlier than planned as the german economy recovers , unions want higher pay .
most employers say such demands are premature - but not auto parts supplier bosch .
it says the time has come to " reward " staff for their hard work . it was good news for the company 's metal workers : german car component supplier bosch announced on monday it would raise employees ' wages earlier than expected .
bosch initially planned to introduce a 2.7 percent pay hike for its 85,000 workers from april next year .
that start date has now been moved forward to february 1 , 2011 .
bosch is making use of a so-called " flexibility clause " in its wage agreement with the metal branch .
this allows wage adjustments to be brought forward or postponed by two months , depending on the company 's current economic situation .
bosch made use of the clause last year to delay a pay rise .
bosch thanks employees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch says it 's rewarding employees for their loyalty " since we 've seen economic recovery materialize earlier than expected we will again make use of the flexible components of our wage agreement , only this time it will be to the benefit of our employees , " said wolfgang malchow , the head of human resources at bosch .
" in difficult times , our employees showed a great sense of loyalty .
we do n't take this for granted and we thank them all , " malchow said .
the announcement makes bosch the first large german company to reward its employees for their role in improving the company 's economic performance .
the group is expecting sales volume to increase 20 percent to roughly 46 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- , while profit forecasts are " very positive " .
performance premium bosch 's announcement is likely to please german economics minister rainer bruederle .
in a recent interview with bild newspaper , bruederle said the current boom was mainly due to the hard work of germany 's labor force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says workers should benefit from the economic boom directly " high performance needs to be rewarded , " he said , adding that this concept be applied to wage agreements wherever possible .
other german companies , however , are reluctant to increase their employees ' pay just yet .
the head of the central union for the german construction sector -lrb- zdb -rrb- , karl robi , said construction companies were not able to pay higher wages because the " economic recovery has n't reached the main construction sector yet .
companies need to earn the money first and invest in higher wages later . "
profits and priorities the president of the employers ' association in the metal sector -lrb- gesamtmetall -rrb- , martin kannegiesser , argued german companies need to get back up on their feet first : " dividends and higher wages are clearly not their first priority now . "
patrick adenauer from the union of family companies -lrb- asu -rrb- warned that undifferentiated demands for pay rises may even threaten the current economic recovery .
" many companies are only barely managing to end short-time employment now and pay christmas bonuses , " adenauer said .
analysts suggest the recovery-reward discussion should focus on how germany can sustain long-term growth .
they argue the fact that germany 's economy is expected to grow by a 3.5 percent this year means companies are merely regaining what they lost during the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers say the economic recovery has not reached all sectors long-term prospects consulting firm mckinsey warns that structural problems - combined with high public debt , low population growth , and a lack of skilled workers – indicate germany 's current boom may be short-lived .
the group 's german director frank mattern told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- : " it was a great second quarter for germany , but over the next few years germany will probably not see growth rates exceeding two percent . "
more money in consumers ' pockets could increase domestic demand , which would be good for the german economy .
but analysts say more comprehensive measures are needed to ensure that the recovery is stable .

organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.10.2010 military commission recommends cuts at german defense ministry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription is likely on its way out in germany an independent commission of military experts has recommended that the german defense ministry make significant cuts to staff and the number of bundeswehr troops , as well as moving the ministry 's headquarters . a report released on tuesday by military experts commissioned by the german defense ministry calls for significant cuts to the number of civilian staff and troops serving in the bundeswehr , germany 's armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg , right , recieves the report from weise the proposed reductions would see the bundeswehr reduced from 250,000 to 180,000 , and the practice of german conscription would no longer exist .
a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

they also agreed on further talks resolve a row over swiss banking secrecy . germany and switzerland have signed an agreement which will make it easier for berlin to get information about - and tax revenue from - german tax evaders .
the agreement , signed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart , hans-rudolf merz in berne , brings to an end years of discord between the two countries .
the german government believes many of its wealthy citizens have invested millions of euros in swiss banks , and thus avoided paying tax on them .
the new dual taxation agreement is one of a series of bilateral deals that switzerland has signed to comply with tougher international standards and new rules set out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the agreement will grant berlin greater access to information on the swiss bank accounts of germans suspected of tax fraud .
anonymity remains for years swiss law made a distinction between tax evasion , tax fraud and money laundering .
the first was not a crime , the last two were .
in effect , wealthy individuals from all over the world could be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money in a swiss bank , it would be safe from the unwelcome scrutiny of the tax authorities in their countries of origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany badly wants the key to that bank deposit safe germany and the united states have long known they are losing billions in tax revenue because it 's hidden in switzerland .
german media have estimated that the deal with berne could recover up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion dollars -rrb- for berlin .
under the terms of the agreement signed on wednesday , german citizens investing in switzerland will keep their anonymity as long as they pay past and future taxes owed to germany . "
the compensation tax payment is a sensible compromise , it gives germany the tax income its government feels it has a right to , but it still protects the anonymity of clients of swiss banks , " swiss professor of economics urs birchler of zurich university told deutsche welle .
" their individual details do n't have to be given automatically to the tax authorities , and for the banks , it 's a clear sign that the future will be one without laundered money , and without money from tax evasion . "
negotiations to continue in 2011 but , german finance minister schaeuble had a word of warning - there is agreement , but the devil , as usual , lies in the detail .
" this agreement is n't a formal treaty between our two countries , there is still a lot of work to do .
but of course it is more than a non-binding intention , it is the opening of a negotiating process , whose framework and contents are very clearly defined - so we know , very precisely , what is meant by these few lines we have signed today . "
berlin and berne have also agreed to continue talks on the issue in 2011 .

it 's a decision that has surprised independent russian newspaper ' novaya gazeta . ' " novaya gazeta , " under close observation by russia 's state-run media control authority , is at risk of being shut down .
six months ago , editors received a first warning ; a second reprimand could result in a withdrawal of the newspaper 's license .
the paper is a symbol for investigative journalism in russia .
its authors stand up for human rights and freedom of expression .
some have lost their lives in the process , among them anna politkovskaya , who was critical of russia 's actions in chechnya , and human rights activist natalya estemirova .
in an article entitled " gang , agency , party : who are the legal nationalists ? " the moscow paper reported on the structure and secretive activities of right-wing extremists , using quotes from the group 's websites .
media control authorities regarded the article as propaganda and handed the paper a reprimand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muratov has to be prepared to go to court for his paper the paper 's editors took the matter to court , where a judge only confirmed the warning .
editor-in-chief dmitry muratov says the ruling is absurd : " all we did in the article was quote the fascists .
and we were the ones to get the reprimand , not them .
that is incredible ! "
reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .
" novaya gazeta " could take the matter to russia 's top court , which had clearly defined what constitutes misuse of press freedom , fedotov he added that the court had made clear that it would not single out individual words or quotes but view them in context .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a long way to go in terms of press freedom , says sokolov disputes with authorities and courts come with the territory , said deputy chief editor sergey sokolov .
" by taking the matter to court , we 've merely been defended ourselves , but we 've never submitted to self-censorship - and we never will , " he said .
no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .
there has been no real improvement in russia concerning freedom of the press , said sokolov .
" it 's not russia that has improved , the countries that we surpassed in the ranking have changed for the worse , " he said .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 27.10.2010 berlin moves to strengthen law against forced marriages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women from immigrant families are bound to marry strangers or relatives the cabinet has approved a proposal that would make forcing someone to marry a felony .
the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.10.2010 germany drops slightly on corruption perceptions index großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped one spot since last year to 15th the global financial crisis took a toll on people 's views of corruption in government , as transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index .
germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .
the institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
the unique research profile of the institute is the result of the cooperation between research , consulting and professional training .
the institute is building bridges between theory and practice and works within international research networks . author : joerg faust editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he met prime minister hun sen on wednesday who gave him a couple of blunt messages . it was hardly the dream start un secretary-general ban ki-moon would have wanted for his first trip to cambodia . less than 24 hours after he landed , prime minister hun sen told him that cambodia wanted the un ’ s human rights office closed and the un ’ s country head sacked . hun sen then informed ban ki-moon that he was utterly opposed to the khmer rouge tribunal charging any further suspects . the tribunal , which is a joint un-cambodian creation and is funded mainly with contributions from un member states , was designed to find some form of justice for the surviving victims of the khmer rouge that is blamed for the deaths of up to 2.2 million people during its rule between 1975 and 1979 . from crisis to crisis but the court has wobbled from crisis to crisis over the past couple of years .
first corruption raised its head , then there were allegations of political interference – which hun sen ’ s comments on tuesday will reignite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un-backed genocide tribunal was set up to find some justice for the victims of the khmer rouge the court has also intermittently run out of money from cash-strapped donor nations , which are themselves struggling in straitened economic times .
however , through it all the court has carried on with its work . earlier this year , the judges confirmed they were investigating five more suspects – whom they did not name – in connection with allegations of involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity , all of which is perfectly in tune with the tribunal ’ s remit .
those new cases are known as cases 3 and 4 . hun sen opposes more cases hun sen came out against them , saying that the trial of comrade duch , the former security chief who was sentenced to 30 years in july , and next year ’ s trial of four senior leaders of the movement , would be quite enough . minister of information khieu kanharith said hun sen was opposed to further cases on a number of grounds – first , because he considers more prosecutions would be outside the remit of the court , and also because the five being investigated in cases 3 and 4 are not high-ranking members of the khmer rouge . " the second reason is that the primary goal of setting up this court is first to find justice for cambodian people , and two is to preserve the peace and political stability in the country . " this could be interpreted as political interference in what is a judicial process . " during the meeting with the prime minister and outside that meeting the secretary-general has made clear that this is a judicial process , those are judicial decisions , and the independence of the court needs to be respected , " ban ki-moon 's spokesman yves sorokobi said . " those are decisions for the court officials to make , and the secretary-general is not in a position whatsoever to make those decisions .
that is not for him to make . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaing guek eav , alias duch , was handed down a 30-year jail sentence in july sorokobi also said that court officials and independent councilors would also decide on whether cases 3 and 4 go ahead .
" we have to give them the space that they need to make the proper decision .
there should be no political interference with their work . " ban ki-moon in a tricky position when it comes to hun sen telling the un that he considers the un 's human rights office here no longer necessary , sorokobi said ban ki-moon would take that on board , since the presence of any human rights office in a member state is a matter of bilateral agreement but he stressed that no formal request to close the office had yet been made . however , regarding selection of staff , hun sen ’ s demand that the country head of the un human rights office in cambodia , christophe peschoux , be sacked , is a different matter . ´ " we just want to make clear for the record that the secretary-general stands by the work of his high commissioner for human rights , and that pulling staff out of a particular country or not is a matter of internal personal issues .
so it 's a matter for the secretary-general to decide .
in the meantime , like i said , we fully stand by the work of the human rights commissioner and by her representatives around the world including here , " sorokobi said . wednesday is the second – and final – day of ban ki-moon 's visit to cambodia before he heads to vietnam and china .
after the surprises in cambodia , he will doubtless be wondering what the rest of his trip has in store . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 27.10.2010 berlin moves to strengthen law against forced marriages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women from immigrant families are bound to marry strangers or relatives the cabinet has approved a proposal that would make forcing someone to marry a felony .
the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .

the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

"
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community .

the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.10.2010 germany drops slightly on corruption perceptions index großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped one spot since last year to 15th the global financial crisis took a toll on people 's views of corruption in government , as transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index .
germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

they also agreed on further talks resolve a row over swiss banking secrecy . germany and switzerland have signed an agreement which will make it easier for berlin to get information about - and tax revenue from - german tax evaders .
the agreement , signed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart , hans-rudolf merz in berne , brings to an end years of discord between the two countries .
the german government believes many of its wealthy citizens have invested millions of euros in swiss banks , and thus avoided paying tax on them .
the new dual taxation agreement is one of a series of bilateral deals that switzerland has signed to comply with tougher international standards and new rules set out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the agreement will grant berlin greater access to information on the swiss bank accounts of germans suspected of tax fraud .
anonymity remains for years swiss law made a distinction between tax evasion , tax fraud and money laundering .
the first was not a crime , the last two were .
in effect , wealthy individuals from all over the world could be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money in a swiss bank , it would be safe from the unwelcome scrutiny of the tax authorities in their countries of origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany badly wants the key to that bank deposit safe germany and the united states have long known they are losing billions in tax revenue because it 's hidden in switzerland .
german media have estimated that the deal with berne could recover up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion dollars -rrb- for berlin .
under the terms of the agreement signed on wednesday , german citizens investing in switzerland will keep their anonymity as long as they pay past and future taxes owed to germany . "
the compensation tax payment is a sensible compromise , it gives germany the tax income its government feels it has a right to , but it still protects the anonymity of clients of swiss banks , " swiss professor of economics urs birchler of zurich university told deutsche welle .
" their individual details do n't have to be given automatically to the tax authorities , and for the banks , it 's a clear sign that the future will be one without laundered money , and without money from tax evasion . "
negotiations to continue in 2011 but , german finance minister schaeuble had a word of warning - there is agreement , but the devil , as usual , lies in the detail .
" this agreement is n't a formal treaty between our two countries , there is still a lot of work to do .
but of course it is more than a non-binding intention , it is the opening of a negotiating process , whose framework and contents are very clearly defined - so we know , very precisely , what is meant by these few lines we have signed today . "
berlin and berne have also agreed to continue talks on the issue in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cholera has become haiti 's latest problem the specter of an epidemic in haiti raises the question : how could a relatively preventable disease break out in a country that is receiving so much foreign assistance ?
deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cholera has become haiti 's latest problem the specter of an epidemic in haiti raises the question : how could a relatively preventable disease break out in a country that is receiving so much foreign assistance ?
deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cholera has become haiti 's latest problem the specter of an epidemic in haiti raises the question : how could a relatively preventable disease break out in a country that is receiving so much foreign assistance ?
deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.10.2010 germany drops slightly on corruption perceptions index großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped one spot since last year to 15th the global financial crisis took a toll on people 's views of corruption in government , as transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index .
germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

they also agreed on further talks resolve a row over swiss banking secrecy . germany and switzerland have signed an agreement which will make it easier for berlin to get information about - and tax revenue from - german tax evaders .
the agreement , signed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart , hans-rudolf merz in berne , brings to an end years of discord between the two countries .
the german government believes many of its wealthy citizens have invested millions of euros in swiss banks , and thus avoided paying tax on them .
the new dual taxation agreement is one of a series of bilateral deals that switzerland has signed to comply with tougher international standards and new rules set out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the agreement will grant berlin greater access to information on the swiss bank accounts of germans suspected of tax fraud .
anonymity remains for years swiss law made a distinction between tax evasion , tax fraud and money laundering .
the first was not a crime , the last two were .
in effect , wealthy individuals from all over the world could be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money in a swiss bank , it would be safe from the unwelcome scrutiny of the tax authorities in their countries of origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany badly wants the key to that bank deposit safe germany and the united states have long known they are losing billions in tax revenue because it 's hidden in switzerland .
german media have estimated that the deal with berne could recover up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion dollars -rrb- for berlin .
under the terms of the agreement signed on wednesday , german citizens investing in switzerland will keep their anonymity as long as they pay past and future taxes owed to germany . "
the compensation tax payment is a sensible compromise , it gives germany the tax income its government feels it has a right to , but it still protects the anonymity of clients of swiss banks , " swiss professor of economics urs birchler of zurich university told deutsche welle .
" their individual details do n't have to be given automatically to the tax authorities , and for the banks , it 's a clear sign that the future will be one without laundered money , and without money from tax evasion . "
negotiations to continue in 2011 but , german finance minister schaeuble had a word of warning - there is agreement , but the devil , as usual , lies in the detail .
" this agreement is n't a formal treaty between our two countries , there is still a lot of work to do .
but of course it is more than a non-binding intention , it is the opening of a negotiating process , whose framework and contents are very clearly defined - so we know , very precisely , what is meant by these few lines we have signed today . "
berlin and berne have also agreed to continue talks on the issue in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .
the institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

it 's a decision that has surprised independent russian newspaper ' novaya gazeta . ' " novaya gazeta , " under close observation by russia 's state-run media control authority , is at risk of being shut down .
six months ago , editors received a first warning ; a second reprimand could result in a withdrawal of the newspaper 's license .
the paper is a symbol for investigative journalism in russia .
its authors stand up for human rights and freedom of expression .
some have lost their lives in the process , among them anna politkovskaya , who was critical of russia 's actions in chechnya , and human rights activist natalya estemirova .
in an article entitled " gang , agency , party : who are the legal nationalists ? " the moscow paper reported on the structure and secretive activities of right-wing extremists , using quotes from the group 's websites .
media control authorities regarded the article as propaganda and handed the paper a reprimand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muratov has to be prepared to go to court for his paper the paper 's editors took the matter to court , where a judge only confirmed the warning .
editor-in-chief dmitry muratov says the ruling is absurd : " all we did in the article was quote the fascists .
and we were the ones to get the reprimand , not them .
that is incredible ! "
reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .
" novaya gazeta " could take the matter to russia 's top court , which had clearly defined what constitutes misuse of press freedom , fedotov he added that the court had made clear that it would not single out individual words or quotes but view them in context .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a long way to go in terms of press freedom , says sokolov disputes with authorities and courts come with the territory , said deputy chief editor sergey sokolov .
" by taking the matter to court , we 've merely been defended ourselves , but we 've never submitted to self-censorship - and we never will , " he said .
no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .
there has been no real improvement in russia concerning freedom of the press , said sokolov .
" it 's not russia that has improved , the countries that we surpassed in the ranking have changed for the worse , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 27.10.2010 france to start carte musique digital music subsidy plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said the music card program will subsidize music france hopes to change young shoppers ' habits by subsidizing the sale of music with a " music card . "
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community . " the government , however , still has n't said exactly which sites or online services the music card will support , although previous reports suggested that it would be for subscription services , and not for individual download services , like apple 's itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record industry said french artist album releases have plummeted due to piracy the music industry has said piracy is slowing down their business , especially in france , where it has said illegal downloading of copyright-protected material is widespread . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .
the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " zimmerman said in an interview earlier this month with deutsche welle . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community .

the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cholera has become haiti 's latest problem the specter of an epidemic in haiti raises the question : how could a relatively preventable disease break out in a country that is receiving so much foreign assistance ?
deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

it 's a decision that has surprised independent russian newspaper ' novaya gazeta . ' " novaya gazeta , " under close observation by russia 's state-run media control authority , is at risk of being shut down .
six months ago , editors received a first warning ; a second reprimand could result in a withdrawal of the newspaper 's license .
the paper is a symbol for investigative journalism in russia .
its authors stand up for human rights and freedom of expression .
some have lost their lives in the process , among them anna politkovskaya , who was critical of russia 's actions in chechnya , and human rights activist natalya estemirova .
in an article entitled " gang , agency , party : who are the legal nationalists ? " the moscow paper reported on the structure and secretive activities of right-wing extremists , using quotes from the group 's websites .
media control authorities regarded the article as propaganda and handed the paper a reprimand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muratov has to be prepared to go to court for his paper the paper 's editors took the matter to court , where a judge only confirmed the warning .
editor-in-chief dmitry muratov says the ruling is absurd : " all we did in the article was quote the fascists .
and we were the ones to get the reprimand , not them .
that is incredible ! "
reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .
" novaya gazeta " could take the matter to russia 's top court , which had clearly defined what constitutes misuse of press freedom , fedotov he added that the court had made clear that it would not single out individual words or quotes but view them in context .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a long way to go in terms of press freedom , says sokolov disputes with authorities and courts come with the territory , said deputy chief editor sergey sokolov .
" by taking the matter to court , we 've merely been defended ourselves , but we 've never submitted to self-censorship - and we never will , " he said .
no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .
there has been no real improvement in russia concerning freedom of the press , said sokolov .
" it 's not russia that has improved , the countries that we surpassed in the ranking have changed for the worse , " he said .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 27.10.2010 berlin moves to strengthen law against forced marriages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women from immigrant families are bound to marry strangers or relatives the cabinet has approved a proposal that would make forcing someone to marry a felony .
the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .

hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

they also agreed on further talks resolve a row over swiss banking secrecy . germany and switzerland have signed an agreement which will make it easier for berlin to get information about - and tax revenue from - german tax evaders .
the agreement , signed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart , hans-rudolf merz in berne , brings to an end years of discord between the two countries .
the german government believes many of its wealthy citizens have invested millions of euros in swiss banks , and thus avoided paying tax on them .
the new dual taxation agreement is one of a series of bilateral deals that switzerland has signed to comply with tougher international standards and new rules set out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the agreement will grant berlin greater access to information on the swiss bank accounts of germans suspected of tax fraud .
anonymity remains for years swiss law made a distinction between tax evasion , tax fraud and money laundering .
the first was not a crime , the last two were .
in effect , wealthy individuals from all over the world could be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money in a swiss bank , it would be safe from the unwelcome scrutiny of the tax authorities in their countries of origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany badly wants the key to that bank deposit safe germany and the united states have long known they are losing billions in tax revenue because it 's hidden in switzerland .
german media have estimated that the deal with berne could recover up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion dollars -rrb- for berlin .
under the terms of the agreement signed on wednesday , german citizens investing in switzerland will keep their anonymity as long as they pay past and future taxes owed to germany . "
the compensation tax payment is a sensible compromise , it gives germany the tax income its government feels it has a right to , but it still protects the anonymity of clients of swiss banks , " swiss professor of economics urs birchler of zurich university told deutsche welle .
" their individual details do n't have to be given automatically to the tax authorities , and for the banks , it 's a clear sign that the future will be one without laundered money , and without money from tax evasion . "
negotiations to continue in 2011 but , german finance minister schaeuble had a word of warning - there is agreement , but the devil , as usual , lies in the detail .
" this agreement is n't a formal treaty between our two countries , there is still a lot of work to do .
but of course it is more than a non-binding intention , it is the opening of a negotiating process , whose framework and contents are very clearly defined - so we know , very precisely , what is meant by these few lines we have signed today . "
berlin and berne have also agreed to continue talks on the issue in 2011 .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

dw-world.de international aid helped haiti , but a lot more is needed due to a massive global help effort , the situation in haiti has stabilized 100 days after a devastating earthquake ravaged the country .
but even the pledged $ 10 billion will not be enough to rebuild haiti .
-lrb- 21.04.2010 -rrb- opinion : reconstruction and recovery in haiti need the people 's support every disaster offers an opportunity , many politicians hope .
for haiti , the tragic earthquake which struck in january is supposed to lead to a new social and economic start for the nation .
but the reality is different .
-lrb- 14.04.2010 -rrb- logistics are key if aid initiatives are to help haiti governments , ngos and individuals all want to help the victims of the earthquake in haiti .
the trick is to convert money and other resources into assistance where and when it 's needed .
in haiti , that 's not an easy task .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 27.10.2010 france to start carte musique digital music subsidy plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said the music card program will subsidize music france hopes to change young shoppers ' habits by subsidizing the sale of music with a " music card . "
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community . " the government , however , still has n't said exactly which sites or online services the music card will support , although previous reports suggested that it would be for subscription services , and not for individual download services , like apple 's itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record industry said french artist album releases have plummeted due to piracy the music industry has said piracy is slowing down their business , especially in france , where it has said illegal downloading of copyright-protected material is widespread . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .
the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " zimmerman said in an interview earlier this month with deutsche welle . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 27.10.2010 self-censorship is out of the question , says russia 's ' novaya gazeta ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom has not really improved in russia , editors say in its 2010 press freedom index , reporters without borders ranked russia higher than in previous years .
it 's a decision that has surprised independent russian newspaper ' novaya gazeta . ' " novaya gazeta , " under close observation by russia 's state-run media control authority , is at risk of being shut down .
six months ago , editors received a first warning ; a second reprimand could result in a withdrawal of the newspaper 's license .
the paper is a symbol for investigative journalism in russia .
its authors stand up for human rights and freedom of expression .
some have lost their lives in the process , among them anna politkovskaya , who was critical of russia 's actions in chechnya , and human rights activist natalya estemirova .
in an article entitled " gang , agency , party : who are the legal nationalists ? " the moscow paper reported on the structure and secretive activities of right-wing extremists , using quotes from the group 's websites .
media control authorities regarded the article as propaganda and handed the paper a reprimand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muratov has to be prepared to go to court for his paper the paper 's editors took the matter to court , where a judge only confirmed the warning .
editor-in-chief dmitry muratov says the ruling is absurd : " all we did in the article was quote the fascists .
and we were the ones to get the reprimand , not them .
that is incredible ! "
reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .
" novaya gazeta " could take the matter to russia 's top court , which had clearly defined what constitutes misuse of press freedom , fedotov he added that the court had made clear that it would not single out individual words or quotes but view them in context .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a long way to go in terms of press freedom , says sokolov disputes with authorities and courts come with the territory , said deputy chief editor sergey sokolov .
" by taking the matter to court , we 've merely been defended ourselves , but we 've never submitted to self-censorship - and we never will , " he said .
no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .
there has been no real improvement in russia concerning freedom of the press , said sokolov .
" it 's not russia that has improved , the countries that we surpassed in the ranking have changed for the worse , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .
the institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
the unique research profile of the institute is the result of the cooperation between research , consulting and professional training .
the institute is building bridges between theory and practice and works within international research networks . author : joerg faust editor : eva wutke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 27.10.2010 france to start carte musique digital music subsidy plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said the music card program will subsidize music france hopes to change young shoppers ' habits by subsidizing the sale of music with a " music card . "
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community . " the government , however , still has n't said exactly which sites or online services the music card will support , although previous reports suggested that it would be for subscription services , and not for individual download services , like apple 's itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record industry said french artist album releases have plummeted due to piracy the music industry has said piracy is slowing down their business , especially in france , where it has said illegal downloading of copyright-protected material is widespread . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .
the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " zimmerman said in an interview earlier this month with deutsche welle . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

unless and until the chinese de-escalate on this count , there is no way india will improve relations with china . " the military exchanges that have been held in the past two and half months will also continue .
i guess because of these indicators one can say that the current relations have become more destabilized . " is china 's attitude changing ? although china officially maintains that the kashmir dispute is for india and pakistan to resolve , many in the indian security establishment feel the visa row suggests a change in china 's attitude in favor of pakistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officially , china has said that the kashmir dispute is one that india and pakistan should resolve alone china 's stapled visa policy together with references to gilgit and baltistan , which are part of pakistan occupied kashmir -lrb- pok -rrb- , as northern areas pakistan by a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson have created an impression that china has changed its neutral stand on the status of kashmir .

this is an indication that china is going to be permanently placed in the region .

" but i think both india and china have to learn basically to live as neighbors , focusing more on peace .
if china continues to walk on the same path , without taking any corrective measures and if india decides to walk on the same path , then the bilateral relations could actually reach a point where both will confront each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.10.2010 germany drops slightly on corruption perceptions index großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped one spot since last year to 15th the global financial crisis took a toll on people 's views of corruption in government , as transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index .
germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .

bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cholera has become haiti 's latest problem the specter of an epidemic in haiti raises the question : how could a relatively preventable disease break out in a country that is receiving so much foreign assistance ?
deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

dw-world.de international aid helped haiti , but a lot more is needed due to a massive global help effort , the situation in haiti has stabilized 100 days after a devastating earthquake ravaged the country .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .

most employers say such demands are premature - but not auto parts supplier bosch .
it says the time has come to " reward " staff for their hard work . it was good news for the company 's metal workers : german car component supplier bosch announced on monday it would raise employees ' wages earlier than expected .
bosch initially planned to introduce a 2.7 percent pay hike for its 85,000 workers from april next year .
that start date has now been moved forward to february 1 , 2011 .
bosch is making use of a so-called " flexibility clause " in its wage agreement with the metal branch .
this allows wage adjustments to be brought forward or postponed by two months , depending on the company 's current economic situation .
bosch made use of the clause last year to delay a pay rise .
bosch thanks employees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosch says it 's rewarding employees for their loyalty " since we 've seen economic recovery materialize earlier than expected we will again make use of the flexible components of our wage agreement , only this time it will be to the benefit of our employees , " said wolfgang malchow , the head of human resources at bosch .
" in difficult times , our employees showed a great sense of loyalty .
we do n't take this for granted and we thank them all , " malchow said .
the announcement makes bosch the first large german company to reward its employees for their role in improving the company 's economic performance .
the group is expecting sales volume to increase 20 percent to roughly 46 billion euros -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- , while profit forecasts are " very positive " .
performance premium bosch 's announcement is likely to please german economics minister rainer bruederle .
in a recent interview with bild newspaper , bruederle said the current boom was mainly due to the hard work of germany 's labor force .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says workers should benefit from the economic boom directly " high performance needs to be rewarded , " he said , adding that this concept be applied to wage agreements wherever possible .
other german companies , however , are reluctant to increase their employees ' pay just yet .
the head of the central union for the german construction sector -lrb- zdb -rrb- , karl robi , said construction companies were not able to pay higher wages because the " economic recovery has n't reached the main construction sector yet .
companies need to earn the money first and invest in higher wages later . "
profits and priorities the president of the employers ' association in the metal sector -lrb- gesamtmetall -rrb- , martin kannegiesser , argued german companies need to get back up on their feet first : " dividends and higher wages are clearly not their first priority now . "
patrick adenauer from the union of family companies -lrb- asu -rrb- warned that undifferentiated demands for pay rises may even threaten the current economic recovery .
" many companies are only barely managing to end short-time employment now and pay christmas bonuses , " adenauer said .
analysts suggest the recovery-reward discussion should focus on how germany can sustain long-term growth .
they argue the fact that germany 's economy is expected to grow by a 3.5 percent this year means companies are merely regaining what they lost during the crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers say the economic recovery has not reached all sectors long-term prospects consulting firm mckinsey warns that structural problems - combined with high public debt , low population growth , and a lack of skilled workers – indicate germany 's current boom may be short-lived .
the group 's german director frank mattern told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- : " it was a great second quarter for germany , but over the next few years germany will probably not see growth rates exceeding two percent . "
more money in consumers ' pockets could increase domestic demand , which would be good for the german economy .
but analysts say more comprehensive measures are needed to ensure that the recovery is stable .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.10.2010 military commission recommends cuts at german defense ministry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription is likely on its way out in germany an independent commission of military experts has recommended that the german defense ministry make significant cuts to staff and the number of bundeswehr troops , as well as moving the ministry 's headquarters . a report released on tuesday by military experts commissioned by the german defense ministry calls for significant cuts to the number of civilian staff and troops serving in the bundeswehr , germany 's armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg , right , recieves the report from weise the proposed reductions would see the bundeswehr reduced from 250,000 to 180,000 , and the practice of german conscription would no longer exist .
a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .

the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .

"
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community . " the government , however , still has n't said exactly which sites or online services the music card will support , although previous reports suggested that it would be for subscription services , and not for individual download services , like apple 's itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record industry said french artist album releases have plummeted due to piracy the music industry has said piracy is slowing down their business , especially in france , where it has said illegal downloading of copyright-protected material is widespread . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .
the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 27.10.2010 berlin moves to strengthen law against forced marriages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women from immigrant families are bound to marry strangers or relatives the cabinet has approved a proposal that would make forcing someone to marry a felony .
the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 27.10.2010 number of german jobless hits 18-year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's labor market seems to have weathered the crisis unemployment in germany stands at its lowest level since 1991 .
according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .

bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

they also agreed on further talks resolve a row over swiss banking secrecy . germany and switzerland have signed an agreement which will make it easier for berlin to get information about - and tax revenue from - german tax evaders .
the agreement , signed by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and his swiss counterpart , hans-rudolf merz in berne , brings to an end years of discord between the two countries .
the german government believes many of its wealthy citizens have invested millions of euros in swiss banks , and thus avoided paying tax on them .
the new dual taxation agreement is one of a series of bilateral deals that switzerland has signed to comply with tougher international standards and new rules set out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
the agreement will grant berlin greater access to information on the swiss bank accounts of germans suspected of tax fraud .
anonymity remains for years swiss law made a distinction between tax evasion , tax fraud and money laundering .
the first was not a crime , the last two were .
in effect , wealthy individuals from all over the world could be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money in a swiss bank , it would be safe from the unwelcome scrutiny of the tax authorities in their countries of origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany badly wants the key to that bank deposit safe germany and the united states have long known they are losing billions in tax revenue because it 's hidden in switzerland .
german media have estimated that the deal with berne could recover up to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion dollars -rrb- for berlin .
under the terms of the agreement signed on wednesday , german citizens investing in switzerland will keep their anonymity as long as they pay past and future taxes owed to germany . "
the compensation tax payment is a sensible compromise , it gives germany the tax income its government feels it has a right to , but it still protects the anonymity of clients of swiss banks , " swiss professor of economics urs birchler of zurich university told deutsche welle .
" their individual details do n't have to be given automatically to the tax authorities , and for the banks , it 's a clear sign that the future will be one without laundered money , and without money from tax evasion . "
negotiations to continue in 2011 but , german finance minister schaeuble had a word of warning - there is agreement , but the devil , as usual , lies in the detail .
" this agreement is n't a formal treaty between our two countries , there is still a lot of work to do .
but of course it is more than a non-binding intention , it is the opening of a negotiating process , whose framework and contents are very clearly defined - so we know , very precisely , what is meant by these few lines we have signed today . "
berlin and berne have also agreed to continue talks on the issue in 2011 .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .
work stoppages that began on oct .
12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros . unions have called for strikes to continue on thursday but disruptions are not expected to be on the scale off last week .
bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .

shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 27.10.2010 france to start carte musique digital music subsidy plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said the music card program will subsidize music france hopes to change young shoppers ' habits by subsidizing the sale of music with a " music card . "
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community . " the government , however , still has n't said exactly which sites or online services the music card will support , although previous reports suggested that it would be for subscription services , and not for individual download services , like apple 's itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record industry said french artist album releases have plummeted due to piracy the music industry has said piracy is slowing down their business , especially in france , where it has said illegal downloading of copyright-protected material is widespread . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . last year , a report by former virgin france director patrick zelnik said for every track legally bought online in france that there are 20 tracks downloaded illegally and that many people currently downloading music illegally would be willing to pay if the price of digital music was lower . but the music card also has some detractors .
the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " zimmerman said in an interview earlier this month with deutsche welle . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.10.2010 military commission recommends cuts at german defense ministry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription is likely on its way out in germany an independent commission of military experts has recommended that the german defense ministry make significant cuts to staff and the number of bundeswehr troops , as well as moving the ministry 's headquarters . a report released on tuesday by military experts commissioned by the german defense ministry calls for significant cuts to the number of civilian staff and troops serving in the bundeswehr , germany 's armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg , right , recieves the report from weise the proposed reductions would see the bundeswehr reduced from 250,000 to 180,000 , and the practice of german conscription would no longer exist .
a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .
work stoppages that began on oct .
12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros . unions have called for strikes to continue on thursday but disruptions are not expected to be on the scale off last week .
bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .
work stoppages that began on oct .
12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros . unions have called for strikes to continue on thursday but disruptions are not expected to be on the scale off last week .
bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .
the institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg , right , recieves the report from weise the proposed reductions would see the bundeswehr reduced from 250,000 to 180,000 , and the practice of german conscription would no longer exist .
a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

dw-world.de international aid helped haiti , but a lot more is needed due to a massive global help effort , the situation in haiti has stabilized 100 days after a devastating earthquake ravaged the country .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler took the decision to step down from the presidency arguably , one of the biggest problems merkel has faced since the election has been the resignation of six of 10 christian democrat state premiers or city-state mayors .
the cdu suffered a further blow earlier this year when president horst koehler left office following widespread criticism of a comment he made suggesting some german military missions abroad only served the country 's economic interests .
some accused merkel 's government of not rallying around the president , whose roots were with the cdu despite his non-partisan position of power .
and in august , further splits appeared over pension reforms when merkel 's economics minister , free democrat rainer bruederle , took a swipe at the chancellor , labeling the lagging pace of the reforms as disappointing .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , the vice chancellor and head of the fdp , has attempted to put a positive spin on the last year : " it 's my observation that the economy has grown , and unemployment has dropped , " he said recently .
he said the government had performed well on matters of security and civil rights , and also " substantially well on reforms to the social security system . "
that does n't appear to be enough for voters .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 27.10.2010 berlin moves to strengthen law against forced marriages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women from immigrant families are bound to marry strangers or relatives the cabinet has approved a proposal that would make forcing someone to marry a felony .
the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .
work stoppages that began on oct .

bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .
this meant they were able to respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . author : andreas illmer -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unless and until the chinese de-escalate on this count , there is no way india will improve relations with china . " the military exchanges that have been held in the past two and half months will also continue .
i guess because of these indicators one can say that the current relations have become more destabilized . " is china 's attitude changing ? although china officially maintains that the kashmir dispute is for india and pakistan to resolve , many in the indian security establishment feel the visa row suggests a change in china 's attitude in favor of pakistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officially , china has said that the kashmir dispute is one that india and pakistan should resolve alone china 's stapled visa policy together with references to gilgit and baltistan , which are part of pakistan occupied kashmir -lrb- pok -rrb- , as northern areas pakistan by a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson have created an impression that china has changed its neutral stand on the status of kashmir . " china ’ s role in kashmir is proactive , " kondapalli said .
" it has crossed the red line of the equation between india and china .
president hu jintao gave an interview to the xinhua news agency suggesting that he was happy that the infrastructure projects have been going on .
this is an indication that china is going to be permanently placed in the region . " india has suspended high-level defense exchanges a couple of months ago india expressed its displeasure by suspending high-level defense exchanges with china after beijing refused to give a normal visa to a senior army official because he headed troops in an allegedly " disputed " area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say that china is likely to become increasingly present in the kashmir valley this is expected to be india ’ s stand till beijing reverts to its long-held position on jammu and kashmir . " i do n't think this could be an impediment in the bilateral relations in the long term , " says d. v. shekar from the centre of east asian studies .
" but i think both india and china have to learn basically to live as neighbors , focusing more on peace .
if china continues to walk on the same path , without taking any corrective measures and if india decides to walk on the same path , then the bilateral relations could actually reach a point where both will confront each other .

the constitutional council is now to examine the bill , while unions have vowed to continue strikes and demonstrations . france 's national assembly has given its final approval to the government 's controversial pension reform plan .
the senate had approved the final text of the bill on tuesday .
the legislation would increase the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 while the full pension age is to be raised from 65 to 67 .
wednesday 's vote was the last parliamentary hurdle on the way of the reform plan becoming law .
the lower house of parliament passed the bill by a vote of 338 to 233 despite weeks of nationwide strikes that have threatened to bring france to a standstill .
work stoppages that began on oct .
12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros . unions have called for strikes to continue on thursday but disruptions are not expected to be on the scale off last week .
bildunterschrift : thousands have taken to the streets to protest constitutional council to examine the bill the opposition socialist party has said it would lodge an appeal with france 's constitutional council , which will have to rule on whether the reform is legal .
unless the reform is rejected by the court , president nicolas sarkozy is expected to sign the bill by mid-november .
the law is to begin coming into force by the middle of 2011 , but the review is n't scheduled to be completed until 2013 .
therefore , the elections in 2012 are expected to largely focus on the controversial legislation , which has been spearheaded by sarkozy and his conservative ump party .
sarkozy 's popularity ratings have nosedived in recent weeks .
polls indicate that he currently has the support of no more than 30 percent of french voters .
last week 's strike action and demonstrations against the pension reform plan , however , were backed by a majority of those polled .

according to government figures , less than three million - or 7.5 percent - are out of work .
analysts expect the positive trend to continue . the number of people looking for a job in germany has fallen to below the three-million mark , labor minister ursula von der leyen announced on wednesday .
unemployment now stands at a seasonally adjusted 7.5 percent . according to government figures , just over 2.9 million germans were jobless by end of october - 86,000 fewer than in the previous month .
von der leyen described the reduction in the jobless number as a " big success " - the new figure is the lowest since 1991 .
economics minister rainer bruederle , meanwhile , expressed optimism that the positive trend would continue .
" this is not just a one-day success , " he said .
unemployment figures have been dropping gradually since mid-2009 .
positive outlook for 2011 analysts predict the number of unemployed to briefly rise above three million early next year but for most of 2011 the figures are expected to remain below that threshold .
the reason being cited for the strong labor market is germany 's quick recovery from the global financial crisis .
just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 percent . but now exports are booming and german companies are reporting solid profits .
during the recession , a government program to subsidize shortened working hours for employees , allowed german companies to avoid layoffs .

the bill , intended to protect women from immigrant families , also calls for stricter oversight of integration course attendance . germany 's ongoing debate over the integration of foreigners took on a new form this week when the cabinet gave its approval to an interior ministry plan to strictly outlaw the practice of forced marriage .
precise figures as to how many women are being forced to marry against their will , usually to men of their family 's choosing from their ancestral homelands , are not available .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that as many as several hundred in germany are being forced to marry against their will every year .
in any case , for members of the current center-right government like max stadler , a legal expert for the coalition 's junior partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the problem was urgent enough to tackle .
" the freedom to pick a spouse of one 's choice is such a fundamental liberty that we felt we needed to protect it by law , " he said .
substantive measures the bill , which the german cabinet approved on wednesday , would make it a felony to force someone to marry .
forced marriage had already been ruled illegal under federal statutes barring aggravated coercion , but the new legislation , which would provide for sentences of up to five years in prison , would make the prohibition more specific .
it would also significantly lengthen the time period in which women who have lived in germany , but were then taken abroad to enter into forced marriages , woulld have to lodge complaints with german authorities , in order to regain their right to residence in germany .
up until now , women affected by the practice could lose their right to live in germany after six months .
under the new law they would have 10 years to seek legal recourse .
justice minister sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger described the bill as a strong signal that the government was not prepared to tolerate traditions that it feels run counter to german values , and that expected families with immigrant backgrounds to take on those values .
still , she said , the law was no magic wand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheuser-schnarrenberger pushed for the bill " cases of forced marriages have to be dealt with by investigators who largely depend on the information given to them , and it 's clear that the problems police have in obtaining relevant information wo n't go away by virtue of our new legislation , " she said .
welcome step the right of women to turn to german authorities for help for up to 10 years after a forced marriage , even in the face of disapproval by their families , is an important step , said heidemarie grobe of terre des femmes .
the group , which is active in many women 's rights issues including the prevention of forced marriages , receives about 400 calls a year from women who feel they are under threat of forced marriage .
" it used to be that families could send their daughter ‘ home ' , " said grobe , " take away her passport or residency papers , and after six months she could n't do anything about it . "
grobe , a sociologist who often gives talks to schoolchildren on women 's rights issues , takes pride in the rights german women have won , and likes to remind girls from immigrant backgrounds that it was n't always that way .
" i always tell them ‘ my own great-grandmother was forced to marry - we had such circumstances too , " ' she said .
" i do the work that i do so that those times do n't ever come back . "
taking attendance another element of the bill would mandate that immigrants who have been told to attend integration courses must do so within a certain time or face penalties , up to and including deportation .
the senior coalition partners , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- trumpeted the provision as a way of getting tough on immigrants who draw benefits from the state but are unwilling to integrate .
" given that these migrants enjoy state benefits it seems only fair and logical that regional authorities should regularly check whether people really attend these courses , or are refusing to do so , " said the cdu 's spokesman on interior affairs , wolfgang bosbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grobe thinks more immigrant women would like to take integration courses terre des femmes ' grobe believes , however , that another reason may lie behind the poor attendance record of a large number of immigrants .
" we know of a very large number of women whose husbands wo n't allow them to go to integration courses - they simply do n't want them to , " she said . grobe believes the new , tougher attendance checks could make those men relent , allowing their wives to learn the german language and familiarize themselves with the country 's educational system .

"
but the government has not yet said which online services people will be able to use to make purchases . the french government said tuesday that its carte musique , or " music card , " plan to subsidize digital music would begin on thursday and also unveiled a some of the plan 's details .
the move comes two weeks after the european union approved the french music subsidy . the music card subsidy lets french residents between the ages of 12 and 25 purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- music card for only 25 euros with the state paying the remaining 25 euros .
credit on the card can then spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and that people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are accustomed to getting everything online for free . the government statement published tuesday also said a " substantial portion " of the tracks available under the subsidy plan should be for french-language music , or music sung in one of france 's regional languages , such as corsican , basque or breton . the statement added that the music platforms must be " hosted in france , in the european union , or in a signatory state of the european economic community .

the plan amounts to nothing more than a handout to the music industry , and it is unlikely to convince people to buy music when the subsidy runs out , according to jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

the loss compared to a profit of 1.4 billion euros during the same period in 2009 .
the overall third-quarter loss was expected and deutsche bank had warned in september that it expected the postbank acquisition to depress its balance sheet .
the loss came in slightly lower than expected ; analysts polled by reuters had expected the bank to report a net loss of 1.33 billion euros .
the bank said on september 21 that it would incur a charge of 2.3 billion euros as part of the re-evaluation of its holdings in postbank .
deutsche bank owns nearly 30 percent of postbank but has offered to buy all of the shares as it would like to increase its stake to more than 50 percent by the end of this year .
broadening its revenue base the postbank takeover is part of a deutsche bank strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the investment banking business by stepping up retail banking operations .
" our retail banking operation is vastly increasing its footprint in germany , which will balance our earning towards an even more stable business , " said deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann upon releasing the results .
excluding the postbank charge , deutsche bank reported that it had a third-quarter net profit of 1.1 billion euros .
as was the case with several of its rivals , deutsche bank 's financial markets earnings were subdued during the quarter .
" in the third quarter 2010 , the expected seasonal slowdown in client activity in july and august was exacerbated by ongoing sovereign risk concerns , " said the bank .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

it 's a decision that has surprised independent russian newspaper ' novaya gazeta . ' " novaya gazeta , " under close observation by russia 's state-run media control authority , is at risk of being shut down .
six months ago , editors received a first warning ; a second reprimand could result in a withdrawal of the newspaper 's license .
the paper is a symbol for investigative journalism in russia .
its authors stand up for human rights and freedom of expression .
some have lost their lives in the process , among them anna politkovskaya , who was critical of russia 's actions in chechnya , and human rights activist natalya estemirova .
in an article entitled " gang , agency , party : who are the legal nationalists ? " the moscow paper reported on the structure and secretive activities of right-wing extremists , using quotes from the group 's websites .
media control authorities regarded the article as propaganda and handed the paper a reprimand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muratov has to be prepared to go to court for his paper the paper 's editors took the matter to court , where a judge only confirmed the warning .
editor-in-chief dmitry muratov says the ruling is absurd : " all we did in the article was quote the fascists .
and we were the ones to get the reprimand , not them .
that is incredible ! "
reporters hope for fair assessment but the reprimand can still be repealed , according to mikhail fedotov , the former chief of the russian journalists federation and current head of the human rights council , a government body .
fedotov took up the position earlier this month after his predecessor , human rights activist ella pamfilova , resigned in protest against the enhanced powers granted the russian secret service , fsb .
" novaya gazeta " could take the matter to russia 's top court , which had clearly defined what constitutes misuse of press freedom , fedotov he added that the court had made clear that it would not single out individual words or quotes but view them in context .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a long way to go in terms of press freedom , says sokolov disputes with authorities and courts come with the territory , said deputy chief editor sergey sokolov .
" by taking the matter to court , we 've merely been defended ourselves , but we 've never submitted to self-censorship - and we never will , " he said .
no real improvement " russia would not have improved its ranking by 13 slots in this year 's freedom index by reporters without borders if the ' novaya gazeta ' incident had happened earlier , " fedotov said .
the press watchdog annually ranks countries according to their respect for press freedom , and russia this year scored 140th position up from last year 's 153rd .
there has been no real improvement in russia concerning freedom of the press , said sokolov .
" it 's not russia that has improved , the countries that we surpassed in the ranking have changed for the worse , " he said .

germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

deutsche welle searches for some answers . when various nations around the world committed the equivalent of hundreds of millions of euros earlier this year to help haiti recover from january 's devastating earthquake , all of them stressed that rebuilding would take time .
and if anyone was under the illusion that progress would come quickly , they received a wake-up call last week when cholera - a disease virtually unknown in haiti for decades - broke out in the remote artibonite region .
more than 3,000 people contracted the disease and more than 250 people have died from it so far since the first case was recorded last week , causing some to cast a critical eye on the effectiveness of relief efforts in haiti .
in an article for germany 's weekly die zeit newspaper , journalist sven stockrahm questioned why , 10 months on from the earthquake , haitian authorities and the international community had been unable to ensure fresh drinking water and proper sanitation in the north of the country .
" huge sums in aid money have gone there , but the people in the north seem to have been left to their own devices , " stockrahm told deutsche welle .
" that seems pretty astonishing . "
stockrahm stresses that his critical remarks are not at all aimed at humanitarian aid workers , who by all accounts are doing vital work under very trying circumstances .
the key question is whether a better coordination of the resources in place could have prevented cholera from occurring in the first place .
but clear answers are difficult to come by where haiti is concerned .
preventable or not ?
bildunterschrift : many of the initial victims were children the causes of cholera , lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation , are well-known , but at present , no one is sure exactly how the disease even broke out in artibonite .
according to one speculation , the cholera bacteria may have been unwittingly introduced by aid workers themselves , but that is a mere rumor .
what is certain is that conditions in haiti even before the earthquake were far from adequate .
a study by the world health organization and unicef found that open defecation was prevalent among just under half of rural haitians and that 3.7 million of haiti 's total population of 9 million had no reliable source of clean drinking water .
moreover , from 1990 to 2008 , conditions deteriorated .
a similar study by the united nations in 2009 determined that 42 percent of haitians were not using an " improved water source . "
haiti ranks dead last among countries in south america and the caribbean in all major water and hygiene categories .
" cholera is a sickness of poverty that is common in refugee camps where there ’ s not enough drinking water , " ernst diekmann - a doctor with germany 's society for technical cooperation , or gtz - told deutsche welle .
" haiti was already an underprivileged country , and the situation was exacerbated by the natural catastrophe . "
and as of september , there are still more than a million haitians refugees from the earthquake .
" the disease broke out in camps populated by refugees , that is to say : people who fled the earthquake to safe regions and who live there under primitive conditions , " joost butenop , a medical adviser to the aid organization caritas , told deutsche welle .
" aid organizations have concentrated on the region specifically affected -lsb- by the earthquake -rsb- and have n't been following the refugees to any great extent . "
organizational challenges bildunterschrift : aid agencies have been scrambling to respond nonetheless , aid workers acknowledge that pre-existing deficiencies and the slow recovery process are two parts of the same overall problem that encouraged the cholera outbreak .
" the dramatic thing about haiti is that even before the earthquake the health infrastructure was fully inadequate , " butenop said .
" what was there was then destroyed , and reconstruction is proceeding very sluggishly .
in that sense , there is always a greater danger of seeing the things we are now . "
earlier this year , the humanitarian organization refugees international went even further , claiming that recovery efforts in haiti were not just sluggish , but " paralyzed . "
off the record , many people who work in the aid and assistance sector say that shortcomings in coordination often prevent help from getting where it 's needed - or problems from being effectively anticipated .
that task falls to the united nations and the haitian government , and representatives of the former have openly admitted that the situation in haiti tests their limits .
" we have one of the largest-scale humanitarian operations in the world running now ... and just keeping that show on the road is a huge job , " imogen wall , a spokeswoman for the un 's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs , told al jazeera in response to the statement by refugees international .
the will to help is there .
germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development , for instance , says that most of the 51.4 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- it was allocated for haiti has already been distributed or earmarked for future projects .
yet merely distinguishing between emergency needs and long-term developmental requirements , and figuring out which government ministry is responsible , can be a complicated process .
and coordinating the enormous number of private and public organizations trying to help in haiti represents an organizational task of the highest order .
at this point , no one can say definitively whether any particular authority should have foreseen the danger of cholera in haiti and taken precautionary steps to prevent it .
but the outbreak of the disease in a country that has been the focus of so much international assistance suggests that overall organization and coordination remain problems that hinder aid initiatives from having their maximum possible effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.10.2010 dramatic year sees merkel government flailing at polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say merkel 's cdu and partners , the fdp , have n't gelled a year into office , the government of chancellor angela merkel is feeling the strain of low popularity .
the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .

the past 12 months have been bumpy , with several resignations and disagreements between the coalition partners . one year after germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- reached a deal to form the country 's new coalition government , voter disaffection with the cdu-fdp union was at a high .
according to results of a stern-rtl poll released wednesday , only around 35 percent of germans were satisfied with the work done by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which won reelection last year in a narrow victory over their former " grand coalition " partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the poll noted a dramatic drop in support for the junior coalition partners , the fdp , to around five percent ; the party had garnered nearly 15 percent of national votes in the september 27 election last year .
according to the poll , voters currently preferred a coalition of the spd and the greens , as the latter continued to record strong figures .
around 47 percent of germans polled said they would prefer such a left-leaning government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the green way ' : the greens have done well in recent polls previous german governments had managed to return to popularity after poor poll showings after a year into office , the head of polling institute forsa , manfred guellner , told weekly magazine stern .
the spd-greens government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder was one such example .
guellner added , however , that a drop in support for a junior coalition partner , as was being experienced by the fdp , was a damaging development for merkel 's government .
" many fdp voters have been doubly disappointed , " he said .
" they switched from voting for the cdu to voting for the fdp , and now they 're also turning away from this party in frustration . "
year of controversy the coalition government began its tenure under the strain of a global financial crisis that had seen the german economy in its worst downturn since world war ii .
following the election campaign , cracks emerged between the cdu and fdp when the liberals began squabbling with the christian democrats over key campaign pledges , such as tax cuts .
the year also saw a string of high-profile resignations within the cdu 's inner circle , and high public discord over a eurozone debt crisis and the prospect of german taxpayers being made to bail out other countries in the monetary union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 27.10.2010 opinion : more aid does not always mean better aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is not always managed effectively there is increasing evidence to show that the volume of aid provided is not the only critical factor in helping developing nations .
managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .
there is a need for more transparency and an independent assessment of the development programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. joerg faust is a researcher at the german development institute without a doubt , these are not problems to which simple solutions can be found .
to be sure - like in national education , health and environmental policy - the search of solutions will give rise to intense debate because regulatory reforms in times of scarce resources produce winners and losers .
but regulatory success is highly in demand from a collective perspective of the policy field and therefore should form the heart of the debate on aid effectiveness . whether it will be possible to mobilize five or ten percent more or less funding is , in view of the regulatory tasks , first and foremost of lesser significance – although a large number of organizations that profit from development policy funding will of course vehemently deny that . this column reflects the opinions of the authors . dr joerg faust is the head of the governance , statehood , security department of the bpnn-based think tank deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik , the german development institute . the german development institute is one of the leading think tanks for development policy worldwide .
the institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
the unique research profile of the institute is the result of the cooperation between research , consulting and professional training .

managing this aid correctly just as crucial , argues commentator joerg faust . the united nations summit on the millennium development goals ended a few weeks ago .
like many others , the german chancellor angela merkel said that it was not only the financial resources made available to development cooperation that were important , but rather how effectively those resources were employed .
these statements reflect the growing consensus that the volume of aid does not necessarily determine its effectiveness in terms of achieving key goals such as poverty reduction , peacekeeping and promoting democracy . cross-country comparisons do not provide robust statistical evidence that the volume of transfers has positive effects on economic development or " good " governance .
whether or not development policy is effective is thus not only dependent on the volume of aid , but also on the quality of the development policy interventions as a whole in a particular country .
a considerable number of regulatory policy reforms are needed in order to boost aid effectiveness . more money does n't guarantee results development cooperation often addresses countries with limited administrative capacities , limited rule of law and low levels of democratic participation .
it can , therefore , hardly be assumed that more money poured into such countries will automatically lead to greater effectiveness .
as a result , development policy is always a risky investment of public resources . minimizing the endogenous risks of development cooperation requires not only partner countries , but also donors , who have a key role to play .
however , one can not automatically assume that aid and foreign policy agencies on the donor side will always focus their efforts on achieving the collective goals of the policy field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel agrees that aid needs good planning much like large parts of national health and education policy , cross-border development assistance is characterized by the redistribution of resources through the state , which comes along with huge challenges for regulatory policy .
very few would doubt the appropriateness of redistribution in domestic social policies , but it is also evident that interest groups active in these policy fields are not acting solely in the public 's interests . here there is need for state intervention : not for taking over private activities or building bureaucratic monsters , but for establishing a regulatory framework that sets strong incentives for self-interested organizations to gear their efforts towards the achievements of collective goals . regulation reform needed the same can be said of development policy .
most non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , government implementing agencies , as well as multilateral organisations such as the world bank or the united nations development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- would most likely agree that international development funding must be increased because all these organizations benefit from that increase .
but this common preference for more funds says little about how the strategic and organizational positioning of international cooperation can contribute to effectiveness and efficiency .
however , growing criticism of the international aid industry and donor governments ' subsequent commitment to institutional reforms indicate the need for reforms . there are numerous regulatory problems in this policy field , including the proliferation of actors , projects and instruments over the past few decades , the escalating lobby activities of development policy actors in their play for scarce resources , the insufficient attention being paid to conflicting objectives in a steadily growing catalogue of goals and the duplication of responsibilities among multilateral and bilateral actors .
all these deficiencies pose regulatory challenges that require highly differentiated solutions . how are we to deal with economically successful autocracies such as ethiopia and vietnam , whose support may possibly benefit poverty reduction but which can also stabilize authoritarian structures ?
how are we to organize an effective division of labor between donors so as to relieve the administrative burden on recipients ’ state structures , which particularly in least developed countries -lrb- lcds -rrb- tend to be further weakened rather than strengthened on account of project proliferation ?
how can the legitimate bilateral interests of individual donors be embedded in an international framework that is underpinned by a weak and fragmented un system ?
how can the billions pledged to developing countries for the required turnaround in climate policy be absorbed by states whose capacity to act is usually classed as insufficient or precarious ? greater effort for common benefits in order to be able to find answers to these questions , donor countries need parliaments that are capable of aggregating disperse interests in encompassing programs and governments that face up to their task of implementing regulatory frameworks geared towards the common good .
for development assistance this applies at the national but even more so at the international level , since the effectiveness of this increasingly borderless policy field can be influenced only to a very limited degree by purely bilateral strategies . moreover , more courage is needed to openly address these problems rather than to cultivate the discourse that development policy ’ s effectiveness is essentially dependent on the amount of money spent .
taxpayers and recipients alike have a hard time understanding the current international aid system .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.10.2010 germany drops slightly on corruption perceptions index großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped one spot since last year to 15th the global financial crisis took a toll on people 's views of corruption in government , as transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index .
germany dropped somewhat , but remained highly ranked . germans ' confidence in the integrity of their government dropped slightly from a year ago , according to an international watchdog group 's most recent study of how people see corruption in their government .
transparency international released its 2010 corruption perceptions index on tuesday , ranking germany 15th out of 178 countries surveyed .
the group bases the index on 13 different expert and business surveys which ask executives , risk assessors , journalists and others how serious they see forms of corruption like bribery in their country .
the rankings are based on scores from zero to 10 , zero being seen as highly corrupt and 10 being seen as with no corruption .
germany received a score of 7.9 .
transparency international 's regional director for europe and central asia , miklos marschall , said several corporate scandals actually helped germany in its ranking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's campaign against corruption has had little success " we can see that the authorities are very firm on the anti-corruption commitments , " he told deutsche welle .
" the law enforcement is competent , and despite the many big scandals , germany 's position remains relatively good . "
russia hits new low denmark , new zealand and singapore tied at the top of the index as having the world 's lowest perceived corruption .
the country that ranked last was somalia , followed by myanmar , afghanistan and iraq .
russia received its lowest ranking since the index began in 1995 , and the lowest ranking in the group of 20 leading world economies , dropping to 154th place from 146th in 2009 .
the results were bad news for russian president dmitry medvedev 's highly-publicized campaign to crack down on corruption .
" you can not battle corruption with words and nice bits of paper , " said yelena panfilova , head of the russian branch of the watchdog group .
" there has been no success ... the struggle with corruption has come to a dead end . "
trust drops after financial crisis the global financial crisis also appears to have taken a toll on public trust in governments , with the united states , greece , italy and hungary all dropping in their rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks ' trust in the authorities has fallen significantly greece , whose government has introduced a series of harsh cuts to public sector pay to deal with a massive budget deficit , dropped seven spots from last year to 78th , alongside china , lesotho and colombia .
hungary and italy both fell four places , to 50th and 67th respectively , while the united states dropped out of the " top 20 " for the first time and fell to 22nd from 19th last year .
while a population 's perception of how corrupt their government is can be useful in measuring actual corruption , the index has its limits .
a drop in ranking can often result from the exposure of corruption that had already existed for some time , said transparency international 's francois valerian .
" this index does not measure corruption because it is extremely difficult to objectively measure a phenomenon which is hidden by nature , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg , right , recieves the report from weise the proposed reductions would see the bundeswehr reduced from 250,000 to 180,000 , and the practice of german conscription would no longer exist .
a general conscription of all young men is " no longer necessary for security policies in the foreseeable future , " the report read .
roughly half of the defense ministry 's 3,000 jobs would also be eliminated .
cuts are coming the commission 's suggestions are more or less in line with proposals made from within the ministry itself .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had previously called for troop levels to be reduced to about 160,000 .
zu guttenberg also favored ending conscription in germany .
the main differences between the commission 's report and plans already in the mix at the defense ministry are the exact number of troops to be cut and the job reductions at the ministry itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german troops abroad are in afghanistan the commission was led by frank-juergen weise , who is head of the german labor agency and also a colonel in the reserves .
hedda von wedel , a former president of the german constitutional court and currently the deputy chairwoman of transparency international germany , and former nato general karl-heinz lather were among the others who helped write the report , which was commissioned by zu guttenberg in april .
weise 's report was welcomed by zu guttenberg , who confirmed that drastic measures were needed to modernize the bundeswehr and cut costs .
" cosmetic measures alone will no longer get the job done , " zu guttenberg said in berlin on tuesday .
" as far as i can tell , the direction -lsb- indicated by the commission -rsb- is pretty much spot on . "
however , zu guttenberg was careful not to say that all of the commission 's proposals would be adopted .
moving the ministry in addition to troop and staff reductions , the report suggests moving the defense ministry 's headquarters from its current location in bonn , the former capital , to berlin .
most of germany 's ministries moved to berlin after german reunification in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministry may have to pack up and move as part of the deal that moved the capital to berlin , bonn was guaranteed that it would not have to face job cuts on a large scale because of the move , but opposition green party defense spokesman , omid nouripour , said in an interview with german public radio on tuesday it was high time to act .
" we 're talking about a weekly mass migration of public servants , " he said of the commute between bonn and berlin . " we would certainly be well-advised to call the bonn-berlin treaty into question 20 years after german reunification . "
weise was clear in his assessment why the ministry needed to cut positions .
" there 's definitely no need for so many different and competing command units in the bundeswehr , which have been found to distort and block information on many occasions in the past , " he said in berlin . " in my view only half of the people we have in leading positions right now are required to do a proper job . "
changes coming soon while the total number of german bundeswehr troops would be reduced , the commission recommended increasing the number of troops that are available to serve abroad at any particular time from 7,000 to 15,000 .
these troops would voluntarily sign up for military service and would serve a minimum of 15 months in the armed forces .
civilian posts within the military , also filled by voluntary sign-ups , would be reduced from about 75,000 to 50,000 and serve for a maximum of 23 months , according to the commission 's suggestions .
zu guttenberg said that the commission 's report would be examined and that the government would begin debating on concrete decisions regarding defense cuts in december .

a spokesman for the german shipowners association -lrb- vdr -rrb- , max johns , said such a move was not legislated by international law .
" we do n't believe it would be a clever move to send out private armies on the open sea , " said johns .
" in any case , we do n't believe any such action would be covered by international sea law . "
the british plan calls for 20 armed and privately financed speedboats to patrol the waters off the horn of africa at a cost of 12 million euros -lrb- $ 16.5 million -rrb- a year .
shipowners are currently losing about 115 million euros annually due to piracy .
but johns said a privately financed fleet consisting of combat-ready ships could set a dangerous precedent .
" who knows who might also go out and buy themselves such a fleet , " he said .
the british proposal comes after a german cargo ship was seized off the coast of eastern africa earlier this week .
the vessel was later released safely after the pirates were unable to move the captured ship .
the european union says pirates are currently holding about 20 ships for ransom off the coast of africa .
