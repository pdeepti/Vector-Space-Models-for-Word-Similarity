the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

but they also face other consequences of the financial meltdown . in addition to nations choosing to cut development aid spending , lay-offs of immigrant workers in industrialized countries have resulted in less in remittances going back to families , which results in less spending in these countries . but drops in development aid pose one of the most serious problems , according to tobias hauschild , a policy advisor on essential services and aid financing at oxfam germany , because countries often first decide to cut social and health services . " the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .
if industrialized countries cut their aid it has this direct effect in the developing world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations spent billions bailing out banks and have less to spend on aid as a result of the global economic crisis european union members are spending about 19 billion euro -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- less in development aid this year , which is hitting developing nations hard , according to the european commission . the world 's 56 poorest countries face a $ 65 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- deficit as a result of the crisis , according to oxfam .
in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .

wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "

also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .

the law was passed in parliament with an overwhelming vote in favor of the ban . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i think the burqa is disrespectful to the customs , traditions of a host country or adopted one .
i applaud the decision .
although many more countries feel the same as france and belgium , they are afraid to do something about it .
they can not stand up for their beliefs , because it may be seen as not politically correct or they just do n't want to step on some toes . - stefaye , us the niqab is the right of every muslim woman . - mohamed , ethiopia every person must respect the law of every country .
for example , the women who wear the burqa have to be respectful of the laws of france . - hector , colombia muslims all over the world have been wearing headscarves for years , so why the sudden interest now ?
how does a scarf hurt anyone ?
muslim women and nuns wear scarves as a sign of their faith .
originally christians were also told to cover their heads when entering a church .
i am a muslim woman , i have lots of non-muslim friends and i have a german fiance , yet none of them judged me by my dress and instead got to know me as a person .
covering of the face i can understand people disliking , as your identity is hidden , but seriously , what is wrong with a scarf ?
is n't germany , or france , proud to be multicultural , proud to have different people of different skin ?
should n't a person be judged by their personality and behavior ? - sana , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have .

the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : deutsche welle multimedia package : 20 years of reunification reunified germany is a nation of many faces and variable success beaten by reunification , andre hunger gives up gdr dissidents made history - then disappeared into it east germany 's doping program casts long shadow over victims society -pipe- 15.09.2010 east-west couples defy claim that reunited germans remain worlds apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marriage between easterners and westerners is rare only four percent of all post-reunification marriages have brought together men and women from both parts of the country .
the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2010 developing nations continue to suffer from financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is less work and fewer remittances due to the crisis billions less in development aid spending is just one of the follow-up effects of the global economic crisis that developing nations are dealing with .
but they also face other consequences of the financial meltdown . in addition to nations choosing to cut development aid spending , lay-offs of immigrant workers in industrialized countries have resulted in less in remittances going back to families , which results in less spending in these countries . but drops in development aid pose one of the most serious problems , according to tobias hauschild , a policy advisor on essential services and aid financing at oxfam germany , because countries often first decide to cut social and health services . " the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .
if industrialized countries cut their aid it has this direct effect in the developing world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations spent billions bailing out banks and have less to spend on aid as a result of the global economic crisis european union members are spending about 19 billion euro -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- less in development aid this year , which is hitting developing nations hard , according to the european commission . the world 's 56 poorest countries face a $ 65 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- deficit as a result of the crisis , according to oxfam .
in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 15.09.2010 danish amateur rocket organization regroups after failed launch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket , tycho brahe , was named after the famed 16th-century danish astronomer copenhagen suborbitals launch from the baltic sea failed after a hairdryer was left unplugged , which was meant to blow hot air at a valve .
the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .
" if i said we are going to ban speculation that would be like saying we are going to ban the rain from falling , " barnier told journalists at wednesday 's press conference .
" but speculation has become unrestrained .
so we have to limit the risks of hyper-speculation .
how are we going to do this ?
by shedding light on it , by forcing markets to be transparent .
together with the americans and other regions , we must know who does what . "
barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .
provided the stock price falls as expected , this enables them to turn a profit when they come to repurchase the asset and return it to the owner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky trading can turn a quick profit , or backfire drastically " in normal times , short selling enhances market liquidity and contributes to efficient pricing , but in distressed markets short selling can amplify price falls , leading to disorderly markets and systemic risk , " barnier said .
the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , ultra-nationalistic mongol groups are after the ethnic chinese . they want to , as they say , keep the mongolian blood pure from any other ethnicity .
the far right group dayar mongol take their cue from neo-nazis in europe .
they march through the capital of ulan bator waving swastika flags , giving the hitler salute .
bat enkhayer is the spokesman of the group .
he says that the chinese are responsible for the underdevelopment of the mongolian economy and social injustice within the country .
" mongolia will be benefited only after the chinese are out of the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the capital ulan bator increasing chinese investments a huge stake of foreign direct investments is being placed by china in mongolia .
mongolia is rich in coal and other natural resources .
and chinese companies are dominating the mining and construction business .
but as all far right groups , dayar mongol preaches xenophobia against foreigners .
for bat enkhbayer the chinese are the worst .
" chinese people should leave our country .
we will drive them out of mongolia - all chinese , children of chinese-mongolian couples or chinese with mongolian nationality . "
dayar mongols members are not even averse to physical attacks .
they target mongolian women who have a relationship or sexual interaction with chinese men .
members of the far right group shave such women ’ s heads .
and sometimes tattoo their foreheads - in an eerie parallel to the numbers tattooed on the arms of jewish prisoners at auschwitz in nazi germany .
low support for nazi mongols there are no clear numbers regarding the membership of the group , or their caims to be of pure mongolian blood .
the mongolian historian and social scientist nyam puruv of ulan bator thinks that the support of the nazi mongols among the mongolian society is rather low .
" the dayar mongol may have made much noise two years ago .
but nowadays they don ’ t have much influence in mongolian society .
they pretend to have thousands of members .
but in my opinion , there are maybe some dozens , especially the young and the frustrated who have radical thoughts , have little education or are unemployed . "
but though there have been some actions against chinese citizens , nyam puruv thinks that mongolia is still a safe place for foreigners to visit : " the mongolian society is not xenophobic at all .
far from it , the government is executing a kind of open-door-policy , which sets a high value on tourism and cultural exchange .
mongols are actually well known for their hospitality .
i don ’ t think it is dangerous to be in mongolia , whether for chinese or for tourists . "
is the soviet union to blame ?
experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .

barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .

the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

deutsche welle investigates what modern slavery means and takes a look at cases where kids are being enslaved . depending on how the term is defined , as many 230 million people around the globe are virtual slaves .
the us state department , for instance , defines modern slavery to include various forms of forced labor , involuntary domestic servitude , sex trafficking and child soldiers . american sociologist kevin bales is probably the world 's foremost expert on slavery .
he puts the number of enslaved people at 27 million - and that 's using a narrow definition . " this is about people who can not walk away , who are forced to work without pay and who are operating 24/7 under the threat of violence , " bales said in highly publicized public lecture earlier this year .
" it 's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history . " twenty-seven million , bales says , is more than double the number of people bought and sold in the transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th century . the difference in modern-day slavery , he added , is the drastic drop in prices paid for slaves , with the world average being $ 90 -lrb- 70 euros -rrb- . " people have ceased to be a capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups , " bales said . of those 27 million , around 10 million are probably children , says volker bajus from the german human rights group terres des hommes .
he adds , however , that because of poverty some 100 to 120 million children work in situations that can hardly be described as volitional . and as two examples show , cultural traditions concerning family labor are often warped to support extreme forms of human exploitation . kazakh tobacco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child labor happens not just in kazakhstan , but in more western nations such as turkey the humanitarian organization human rights watch spent two years monitoring the tobacco fields near the city of almaty in kazakhstan .
in a report published this summer , entitled " hellish work : explotation of migrant tobacco workers in kazakhstan , " the group says it found children as young as 10 working there . some of this labor is paid , says the report , while other work is not .
in particular , young immigrants and refugees from the troubled neighboring country of kyrgyzstan are vulnerable to exploitation . " children arrive together with the adult migrants , and they enjoy even less protection than their parents , " human rights activist zulfiya baisakova told deutsche welle . kazakhstan is a former republic of the soviet union , where it was customary for children to work alongside their parents to help bring in the harvest .
sadly , this tradition has been warped to support what may amount to child slavery . " the amazing thing is that according to the children 's answers to questions we ask , at least half of the parents view the practice positively , " said ajunur zhakupova from the almaty office for child protection . the tobacco harvested by these children is used by western companies such as philip morris . fish in ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often used for domestic labor and more dangerous tasks another case of child labor that has attracted a recent attention is fishing in ghana .
although ghanaian law prohibits people under eighteen from engaging in hazardous labor , the practice is widespread , and the conditions often horrific . " trafficked children are sometimes forced to work up to 14 hours a day , and seven days a week amid beatings , " a report commissioned by germany 's madamfo ghana human rights group concluded about two fishing communities in the kpano dictrict .
" sometimes these children drown when they get entangled in the nets or are pulled into the water by big fishes that are trapped in the nets .
some other times , they drown in the initial process of diving because they are not well-trained . " the report notes that the fishermen do n't use their own children for such work but bring in others from other locations .
tragically , say human rights groups , such stories are not rare in africa . " africa has the highest percentage of child labor , and it 's prevalent in western africa , " volker bajus told deutsche welle .
" children work in cocoa plantations and do domestic labor , and it looks as though they are often trafficked . " bajus added the cost of procuring what is essentially a child slave can be around 50 euros . knowledge around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese authorities discovered slave laborers in 2007 there have also been well-documented cases in recent years of children being forced to do dangerous work in brick kilns in india and china .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2010 developing nations continue to suffer from financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is less work and fewer remittances due to the crisis billions less in development aid spending is just one of the follow-up effects of the global economic crisis that developing nations are dealing with .
but they also face other consequences of the financial meltdown . in addition to nations choosing to cut development aid spending , lay-offs of immigrant workers in industrialized countries have resulted in less in remittances going back to families , which results in less spending in these countries . but drops in development aid pose one of the most serious problems , according to tobias hauschild , a policy advisor on essential services and aid financing at oxfam germany , because countries often first decide to cut social and health services . " the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .
if industrialized countries cut their aid it has this direct effect in the developing world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations spent billions bailing out banks and have less to spend on aid as a result of the global economic crisis european union members are spending about 19 billion euro -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- less in development aid this year , which is hitting developing nations hard , according to the european commission . the world 's 56 poorest countries face a $ 65 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- deficit as a result of the crisis , according to oxfam .
in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "

russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "

"
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "

is the soviet union to blame ?
experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

late on tuesday liao was allowed to board a plane in beijing and has since landed in berlin .
“ i ca n't believe this is all happening ... my thoughts are so varied that i ca n't express myself clearly right now , " a clearly excited liao told reporters before getting on the plane . chinese authorities had previously stopped the author from leaving the country 14 times .
although liao insists he is not a political activist , all of his books are banned by the communist government of china , which views his work as subversive .
the last time the 56-year-old writer tried to leave china , in march 2010 , he was on his way to attend a literary festival in cologne , germany .
however , officials stopped him at the airport and placed him under house arrest in his hometown of chengdu , sichuan .
in 1989 he incurred the wrath of the chinese authorities when he penned an epic poem called " massacre " which criticized his government 's brutal crackdown on freedom protestors at tiananmen square in june of that year .
as a result he was jailed for four years .
on his release from prison , liao earned a living as a musician and doing odd jobs .
he also spent time interviewing people on the fringes of chinese society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao yiwu was invited to one of germany 's foremost literary festivals earlier this year honored guest his first book to be published in the united states was called corpse walker , real life stories : china from the bottom up .
this was the beginning of a number of volumes dealing with people living at the bottom of the chinese food chain .
he has also published china 's unjust court cases and the last of china 's landlords the german government has had repeated high-level contacts with china in a bid to gain permission for liao to travel abroad .
now , it seems that persistence has finally paid off .
he is due to be an honored guest at berlin 's international literary festival and the harbor front literature festival in hamburg .
in berlin , liao was met by the director of the berlin literary festival , ulrich schreiber who told reporters , " we are very happy that we have been successful in inviting liao yiwu to germany and that the chinese government agreed to his visit . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .
" we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . " author : cyrus farivar -lrb- reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .

" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2010 eu unveils its plans to end financial market ' wild west ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier wants a showdown with wild west financial traders comparing the current climate on financial markets to the ' wild west ' , eu financial services commissioner michel barnier has outlined plans for tougher controls on the sector , especially on derivatives trading . the european financial services commissioner , michel barnier , presented his proposals on the second anniversary of the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers , the day widely considered as the start of 2008 's dramatic financial downturn .
barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .
" if i said we are going to ban speculation that would be like saying we are going to ban the rain from falling , " barnier told journalists at wednesday 's press conference .
" but speculation has become unrestrained .
so we have to limit the risks of hyper-speculation .
how are we going to do this ?
by shedding light on it , by forcing markets to be transparent .
together with the americans and other regions , we must know who does what . "
barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .
provided the stock price falls as expected , this enables them to turn a profit when they come to repurchase the asset and return it to the owner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky trading can turn a quick profit , or backfire drastically " in normal times , short selling enhances market liquidity and contributes to efficient pricing , but in distressed markets short selling can amplify price falls , leading to disorderly markets and systemic risk , " barnier said .
the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

but they also face other consequences of the financial meltdown . in addition to nations choosing to cut development aid spending , lay-offs of immigrant workers in industrialized countries have resulted in less in remittances going back to families , which results in less spending in these countries . but drops in development aid pose one of the most serious problems , according to tobias hauschild , a policy advisor on essential services and aid financing at oxfam germany , because countries often first decide to cut social and health services . " the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .
if industrialized countries cut their aid it has this direct effect in the developing world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations spent billions bailing out banks and have less to spend on aid as a result of the global economic crisis european union members are spending about 19 billion euro -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- less in development aid this year , which is hitting developing nations hard , according to the european commission . the world 's 56 poorest countries face a $ 65 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- deficit as a result of the crisis , according to oxfam .
in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 15.09.2010 leaders meet as kashmir burns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 90 have been killed in protests so far violence has rocked kashmir for the last three months and top politicians in india have been struggling to find answers to the latest bloodshed .
but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 15.09.2010 leaders meet as kashmir burns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 90 have been killed in protests so far violence has rocked kashmir for the last three months and top politicians in india have been struggling to find answers to the latest bloodshed .
but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 environment minister disclaims responsibility for nuclear plant deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says he had no hand in the nuclear extension deal the german environment minister on wednesday said he and his department played no part in the government 's recent decision to extend the running times of nuclear power plants in germany . environment minister norbert roettgen on wednesday said he had not been involved in the deal to extend the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 15.09.2010 canada 's logging deal fails to appease all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement has been proclaimed good for both loggers and green groups earlier this year canadian loggers and environmentalists signed a landmark agreement hailed as a model of sustainable forestry management .
but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 environment minister disclaims responsibility for nuclear plant deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says he had no hand in the nuclear extension deal the german environment minister on wednesday said he and his department played no part in the government 's recent decision to extend the running times of nuclear power plants in germany . environment minister norbert roettgen on wednesday said he had not been involved in the deal to extend the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "

he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "

parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 15.09.2010 leaders meet as kashmir burns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 90 have been killed in protests so far violence has rocked kashmir for the last three months and top politicians in india have been struggling to find answers to the latest bloodshed .
but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2010 eu unveils its plans to end financial market ' wild west ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier wants a showdown with wild west financial traders comparing the current climate on financial markets to the ' wild west ' , eu financial services commissioner michel barnier has outlined plans for tougher controls on the sector , especially on derivatives trading . the european financial services commissioner , michel barnier , presented his proposals on the second anniversary of the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers , the day widely considered as the start of 2008 's dramatic financial downturn .
barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .
" if i said we are going to ban speculation that would be like saying we are going to ban the rain from falling , " barnier told journalists at wednesday 's press conference .
" but speculation has become unrestrained .
so we have to limit the risks of hyper-speculation .
how are we going to do this ?
by shedding light on it , by forcing markets to be transparent .
together with the americans and other regions , we must know who does what . "
barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .
provided the stock price falls as expected , this enables them to turn a profit when they come to repurchase the asset and return it to the owner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky trading can turn a quick profit , or backfire drastically " in normal times , short selling enhances market liquidity and contributes to efficient pricing , but in distressed markets short selling can amplify price falls , leading to disorderly markets and systemic risk , " barnier said .
the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 15.09.2010 danish amateur rocket organization regroups after failed launch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket , tycho brahe , was named after the famed 16th-century danish astronomer copenhagen suborbitals launch from the baltic sea failed after a hairdryer was left unplugged , which was meant to blow hot air at a valve .
the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 15.09.2010 danish amateur rocket organization regroups after failed launch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket , tycho brahe , was named after the famed 16th-century danish astronomer copenhagen suborbitals launch from the baltic sea failed after a hairdryer was left unplugged , which was meant to blow hot air at a valve .
the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .
" if i said we are going to ban speculation that would be like saying we are going to ban the rain from falling , " barnier told journalists at wednesday 's press conference .
" but speculation has become unrestrained .
so we have to limit the risks of hyper-speculation .
how are we going to do this ?
by shedding light on it , by forcing markets to be transparent .
together with the americans and other regions , we must know who does what . "
barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .
provided the stock price falls as expected , this enables them to turn a profit when they come to repurchase the asset and return it to the owner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky trading can turn a quick profit , or backfire drastically " in normal times , short selling enhances market liquidity and contributes to efficient pricing , but in distressed markets short selling can amplify price falls , leading to disorderly markets and systemic risk , " barnier said .
the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2010 developing nations continue to suffer from financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is less work and fewer remittances due to the crisis billions less in development aid spending is just one of the follow-up effects of the global economic crisis that developing nations are dealing with .
but they also face other consequences of the financial meltdown . in addition to nations choosing to cut development aid spending , lay-offs of immigrant workers in industrialized countries have resulted in less in remittances going back to families , which results in less spending in these countries . but drops in development aid pose one of the most serious problems , according to tobias hauschild , a policy advisor on essential services and aid financing at oxfam germany , because countries often first decide to cut social and health services . " the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .
if industrialized countries cut their aid it has this direct effect in the developing world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu nations spent billions bailing out banks and have less to spend on aid as a result of the global economic crisis european union members are spending about 19 billion euro -lrb- $ 24.7 billion -rrb- less in development aid this year , which is hitting developing nations hard , according to the european commission . the world 's 56 poorest countries face a $ 65 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- deficit as a result of the crisis , according to oxfam .
in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .

opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .

that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "

but now , ultra-nationalistic mongol groups are after the ethnic chinese . they want to , as they say , keep the mongolian blood pure from any other ethnicity .
the far right group dayar mongol take their cue from neo-nazis in europe .
they march through the capital of ulan bator waving swastika flags , giving the hitler salute .
bat enkhayer is the spokesman of the group .
he says that the chinese are responsible for the underdevelopment of the mongolian economy and social injustice within the country .
" mongolia will be benefited only after the chinese are out of the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the capital ulan bator increasing chinese investments a huge stake of foreign direct investments is being placed by china in mongolia .
mongolia is rich in coal and other natural resources .
and chinese companies are dominating the mining and construction business .
but as all far right groups , dayar mongol preaches xenophobia against foreigners .
for bat enkhbayer the chinese are the worst .
" chinese people should leave our country .
we will drive them out of mongolia - all chinese , children of chinese-mongolian couples or chinese with mongolian nationality . "
dayar mongols members are not even averse to physical attacks .
they target mongolian women who have a relationship or sexual interaction with chinese men .
members of the far right group shave such women ’ s heads .
and sometimes tattoo their foreheads - in an eerie parallel to the numbers tattooed on the arms of jewish prisoners at auschwitz in nazi germany .
low support for nazi mongols there are no clear numbers regarding the membership of the group , or their caims to be of pure mongolian blood .
the mongolian historian and social scientist nyam puruv of ulan bator thinks that the support of the nazi mongols among the mongolian society is rather low .
" the dayar mongol may have made much noise two years ago .
but nowadays they don ’ t have much influence in mongolian society .
they pretend to have thousands of members .
but in my opinion , there are maybe some dozens , especially the young and the frustrated who have radical thoughts , have little education or are unemployed . "
but though there have been some actions against chinese citizens , nyam puruv thinks that mongolia is still a safe place for foreigners to visit : " the mongolian society is not xenophobic at all .
far from it , the government is executing a kind of open-door-policy , which sets a high value on tourism and cultural exchange .
mongols are actually well known for their hospitality .
i don ’ t think it is dangerous to be in mongolia , whether for chinese or for tourists . "
is the soviet union to blame ?
experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

" the dayar mongol may have made much noise two years ago .
but nowadays they don ’ t have much influence in mongolian society .
they pretend to have thousands of members .
but in my opinion , there are maybe some dozens , especially the young and the frustrated who have radical thoughts , have little education or are unemployed . "
but though there have been some actions against chinese citizens , nyam puruv thinks that mongolia is still a safe place for foreigners to visit : " the mongolian society is not xenophobic at all .
far from it , the government is executing a kind of open-door-policy , which sets a high value on tourism and cultural exchange .
mongols are actually well known for their hospitality .
i don ’ t think it is dangerous to be in mongolia , whether for chinese or for tourists . "
is the soviet union to blame ?
experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 15.09.2010 prejudices towards former east ' still exist ' , says german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mental divide still exisits in some heads , says the german president it may be 20 years since the berlin wall came down , but german president christian wulff thinks that the east - west divide still exists .
he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 15.09.2010 danish amateur rocket organization regroups after failed launch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket , tycho brahe , was named after the famed 16th-century danish astronomer copenhagen suborbitals launch from the baltic sea failed after a hairdryer was left unplugged , which was meant to blow hot air at a valve .
the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 15.09.2010 perverted family traditions often play a role in modern-day slavery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estimates of the number of slaves around the world run from 27 to 200 million slavery remains a scourge in many parts of the world , with the victims often being children .
deutsche welle investigates what modern slavery means and takes a look at cases where kids are being enslaved . depending on how the term is defined , as many 230 million people around the globe are virtual slaves .
the us state department , for instance , defines modern slavery to include various forms of forced labor , involuntary domestic servitude , sex trafficking and child soldiers . american sociologist kevin bales is probably the world 's foremost expert on slavery .
he puts the number of enslaved people at 27 million - and that 's using a narrow definition . " this is about people who can not walk away , who are forced to work without pay and who are operating 24/7 under the threat of violence , " bales said in highly publicized public lecture earlier this year .
" it 's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history . " twenty-seven million , bales says , is more than double the number of people bought and sold in the transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th century . the difference in modern-day slavery , he added , is the drastic drop in prices paid for slaves , with the world average being $ 90 -lrb- 70 euros -rrb- . " people have ceased to be a capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups , " bales said . of those 27 million , around 10 million are probably children , says volker bajus from the german human rights group terres des hommes .
he adds , however , that because of poverty some 100 to 120 million children work in situations that can hardly be described as volitional . and as two examples show , cultural traditions concerning family labor are often warped to support extreme forms of human exploitation . kazakh tobacco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child labor happens not just in kazakhstan , but in more western nations such as turkey the humanitarian organization human rights watch spent two years monitoring the tobacco fields near the city of almaty in kazakhstan .
in a report published this summer , entitled " hellish work : explotation of migrant tobacco workers in kazakhstan , " the group says it found children as young as 10 working there . some of this labor is paid , says the report , while other work is not .
in particular , young immigrants and refugees from the troubled neighboring country of kyrgyzstan are vulnerable to exploitation . " children arrive together with the adult migrants , and they enjoy even less protection than their parents , " human rights activist zulfiya baisakova told deutsche welle . kazakhstan is a former republic of the soviet union , where it was customary for children to work alongside their parents to help bring in the harvest .
sadly , this tradition has been warped to support what may amount to child slavery . " the amazing thing is that according to the children 's answers to questions we ask , at least half of the parents view the practice positively , " said ajunur zhakupova from the almaty office for child protection . the tobacco harvested by these children is used by western companies such as philip morris . fish in ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often used for domestic labor and more dangerous tasks another case of child labor that has attracted a recent attention is fishing in ghana .
although ghanaian law prohibits people under eighteen from engaging in hazardous labor , the practice is widespread , and the conditions often horrific . " trafficked children are sometimes forced to work up to 14 hours a day , and seven days a week amid beatings , " a report commissioned by germany 's madamfo ghana human rights group concluded about two fishing communities in the kpano dictrict .
" sometimes these children drown when they get entangled in the nets or are pulled into the water by big fishes that are trapped in the nets .
some other times , they drown in the initial process of diving because they are not well-trained . " the report notes that the fishermen do n't use their own children for such work but bring in others from other locations .
tragically , say human rights groups , such stories are not rare in africa . " africa has the highest percentage of child labor , and it 's prevalent in western africa , " volker bajus told deutsche welle .
" children work in cocoa plantations and do domestic labor , and it looks as though they are often trafficked . " bajus added the cost of procuring what is essentially a child slave can be around 50 euros . knowledge around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese authorities discovered slave laborers in 2007 there have also been well-documented cases in recent years of children being forced to do dangerous work in brick kilns in india and china .
yet the negative publicity generated forced some improvements and represents a ray of hope for the future . " the key is education and a will on the part of governments and among the middle classes to fight against people being indentured and enslaved by debts , " bajus said .
" india is a good example , and as a rule , this is happening in the emerging nations . " knowledge can be a tool for liberating people from unnecessarily dire conditions . " exploitation is often based on people not knowing their rights or not being able to calculate whether they are being paid proper wages because they are illiterate , " bajus added .
" education and a good social infrastructure help prevent such abuses . " ironically , globalization is often a factor encouraging modern-day slavery , but the possibilities it opens up for educating people around the world about such exploitation may also be part of the ultimate solution to the problem . zulfiya baisakova and ajunur zhakupova were interviewed by dw 's olga korneeva and tatiana petrenko . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "
domestic tensions while the couple was mastering their everyday challenges in harmony , it was more problematic with hermann 's 14-year-old daughter .
" berlin was an exciting place for his daughter , " said birgit .
" strolling down kurfuerstendamm boulevard and having an ice cream was easy .
but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .
she was just so incredibly spoiled and used to every wish being fulfilled immediately . "
hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : 10 years into their marriage and still happy by then , the couple had settled in the picturesque town of caputh , amid sprawling forests , lakes and the havel river .
hermann continued selling x-ray technology .
birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .
but his efforts to build the hotel did n't win him many friends in the eastern german town .
" i kind of understood the locals , " he said .
" it used to be so quiet here , and then somebody from the west with a big black mercedes comes along and leaves no stone unturned , " he said .
" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "
even the building authorities seemed to eye the western businessman 's intentions with suspicion .
the documents he handed in to secure approval went missing for half a year .
at times the couple felt like abandoning the project in the face of all the red tape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saleswoman turned hotel owner but they stuck it out .
now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 environment minister disclaims responsibility for nuclear plant deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says he had no hand in the nuclear extension deal the german environment minister on wednesday said he and his department played no part in the government 's recent decision to extend the running times of nuclear power plants in germany . environment minister norbert roettgen on wednesday said he had not been involved in the deal to extend the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 15.09.2010 leaders meet as kashmir burns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 90 have been killed in protests so far violence has rocked kashmir for the last three months and top politicians in india have been struggling to find answers to the latest bloodshed .
but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 15.09.2010 leaders meet as kashmir burns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 90 have been killed in protests so far violence has rocked kashmir for the last three months and top politicians in india have been struggling to find answers to the latest bloodshed .
but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .

but back in our apartment we quarrelled about household chores .

hermann 's daughter left out no opportunity to fire broadsides at what she perceived as dumb , backward eastern germans .
but her behavior did not prevent birgit and hermann from finally getting married in 2000 .

birgit , however , decided to realize her dream of running a country-style hotel - with hermann 's help .

" people watched us building the hotel , many of them thinking we 'd go bust before completion anyway . "

now , 13 years since the hotel opened for business and 10 years since they married , birgit and hermann agree that , all in all , fortune has smiled on them .
" we 've grown some gray hair because of it , but we would n't want to be without the experiences we gathered as an east-west couple , " birgit said .
" and we 're still such a strong team . "
hermann nodded his head as he swung his arm around his wife .
" i think we 've done everything right , " he said .
" if you look at the situation in the whole of germany right now , we are definitely not among the losers in this country . "

the different outlooks clashing under one roof can be a boon , says one couple . the farthmanns were an unlikely match .
in 1990 , hermann , who came from bielefeld , western germany , and birgit , from magdeburg , eastern germany , were competitors .
they both marketed and sold x-ray products when hermann arrived in birgit 's hometown with suspicious motives .
" he was planning a hostile takeover of my hospital , " birgit said .
" it was my home turf , and i wanted to sell my products there .
but he wanted the same thing , and so there was a lot of confrontation when we met first . "
hermann , however , was quickly smitten with his resolute business rival .
" that first meeting was an eye-opener for me indeed , " he said .
" i was used to western german women being housewives , and here there was this woman full of self-confidence going about her job like a man .
that impressed me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann farthmann moved east for love five months and umpteen phone calls later , hermann took an irreversible decision .
he left his wife , sold the house he 'd just finished building and moved to berlin with his daughter .
the plan was for birgit to wrap up her life in magdeburg and join him in the reunified city .
" he sort of held a gun to my head , saying it 's your turn now , " birgit recalled .
" it was not easy - as i looked back on 15 years of marriage myself .
but then that new excitement and all the sparks flying in my heart eventually made me follow suit and leave my family behind , too . "
hermann 's fascination with birgit grew as they started planning their life together .
" i looked up to a woman who was very successful in her job , and on top of that managed all the household chores without ever complaining , " hermann said .
" that worked like a magnet . "

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain attack with conventional weapons , greenpeace says . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of the biblis power plant are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation " , meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment " within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant " , she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated " .
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria " .
" shut them down immediately " greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants " , said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 environment minister disclaims responsibility for nuclear plant deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says he had no hand in the nuclear extension deal the german environment minister on wednesday said he and his department played no part in the government 's recent decision to extend the running times of nuclear power plants in germany . environment minister norbert roettgen on wednesday said he had not been involved in the deal to extend the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .

" the tanzanian government had to cut the budget for the fight against hiv and aids by a quarter , " he said .
" that 's only one example , there are other examples .

in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .

in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world .

in the area of microfinance , florian grohs from the microfinance organization oikocredit said bulgaria , romania and russia are also having difficulties , proving that problems are affecting the developed world as well . " we have , for instance , a financing credit cooperative in russia , in the remote areas in saratov , " he said .
" there we saw that all of a sudden micro-entrepreneurs that sell goods on the open markets had 40 percent less turn-over and then also some difficulties to repay their loans . " series of reforms necessary separating food and commodity markets from financial speculation is another major area or concern for developing nations .
in 2007 and 2008 food prices were driven up by speculation , which hit the world 's poorest hardest . the united states is looking at imposing regulations on agricultural speculation - much like they did in the banking sector - but the eu is still lagging behind , according to sony kapoor , a former investment banker who is now head of the re-define think tank , which aims to reform global financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are n't thrilled at the prospect of taxes and levies " the sensible thing to do , because it 's a matter of life and death , is to go for the more conservative option and say that we forbid or strictly limit the amount of financial speculation that can go into anything to do with basic commodity markets - food in particular , " he said . many are calling for a major overhaul of the financial system , which they through deregulation and tax havens has spiraled out of control .
one important change would be to make financial investments focus on the long term rather than turning quick profits that can lead to bubbles like the one experienced in the real estate market , kapoor said . bank levies and transactions taxes foreign cash going moving into far-away real estate , such as in london or other industrialized areas , pushes locals out of the housing market , creating instability , he said .
while that 's a problem for people looking to buy affordable homes , it also creates a dire situation in the developing world . " money which should have stayed in russia , which should have stayed in africa , which should have stayed in latin america and contributed and been invested in domestic businesses does n't stay there , " he said .
" that significantly hinders development . " a financial transaction tax , a bank levy and a cap on bonuses are also necessary steps to shore up the financial system and development , kapoor said . " a financial transaction tax will primarily fall on the shadow-banking system , which is the financial market , hedge funds and such , " he said .
" it is complimentary to a bank levy which will fall primarily on the commercial banking system and the investment banking system .
and having one without the other could lead to some distortion , so having both is good . " support often hard to find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society would benefit from the money a financial tax would generate , oxfam said germany , france and the united kingdom have already agreed to introduce a bank levy from january next year , but it 's been more difficult to convince the entire european union .
there seems to be more support for an eu-wide financial transaction tax , which according to the austrian institute of economic research , could raise 200 billion euros . marita wiggerthale , an agriculture and trade expert at oxfam germany , said a financial tax would benefit society in a number of ways . " oxfam is very much supporting a financial transaction tax not only because it would allow to raise money needed in order to achieve millennium development goals , in order to combat poverty and hunger , but also to curb speculation and to make sure these kind of crises do not occur again , " she said . wiggerthale said she would like to see tax havens closed and a debt moratorium for developing countries whose debt increased because of the crisis . author : cinnamon nippard -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

barnier said he wanted new european legislation to curb derivatives and short selling , two high-risk , poorly regulated forms of trading widely perceived to be the primary cause of the past recession .
" if i said we are going to ban speculation that would be like saying we are going to ban the rain from falling , " barnier told journalists at wednesday 's press conference .
" but speculation has become unrestrained .
so we have to limit the risks of hyper-speculation .
how are we going to do this ?
by shedding light on it , by forcing markets to be transparent .
together with the americans and other regions , we must know who does what . "
barnier said most derivative contracts which banks and firms trade privately rather than on a stock exchange should still be reported to central databases in order to provide regulators with a clearer picture of the market .
stopping short the financial services commissioner also suggested establishing a tracking system for " short selling " , a practice in which traders sell an asset that belongs to someone else - usually it is borrowed from a broker - with the intention of buying it back later for a lower price .
provided the stock price falls as expected , this enables them to turn a profit when they come to repurchase the asset and return it to the owner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : risky trading can turn a quick profit , or backfire drastically " in normal times , short selling enhances market liquidity and contributes to efficient pricing , but in distressed markets short selling can amplify price falls , leading to disorderly markets and systemic risk , " barnier said .
the eu especially wants to limit short selling of sovereign credit default swaps , a derivative that partially represents insurance against the risk of a country defaulting on its national debt .
such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .
barnier 's new proposals are bound to meet opposition in europe , however , with some saying that the new regulations will disadvantage the eu against other , less regulated markets .
" i 've been to the united states , and you will find they are preparing measures very similar to what we have suggested today , " barnier said , adding that he would also be travelling to china , india and brazil to see if other g20 members would commit to implementing comparable regulations .
" some of them might feel tempted to save themselves in the short term , but in the end nobody will escape . "
first of all , though , barnier has the unenviable task of trying to sell his non-binding eu commission suggestions to the european parliament and individual eu member states - only then can they be implemented as law .

such trading further destabilized greece as its debt problems came to light , and with most of the eurozone spending beyond its means , it could pose future threats as well .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.09.2010 polish influx changing the face of uk catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has brought mobility for poles and more catholics to britain pope benedict xvi is heading to britain this week , but many of the roman catholics he meets there may not be british .
the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

the concept has developed into a unique and successful business . her female friends loved the idea immediately , says michaela hansen , but the men were skeptical .
who , after all , could possibly want to look after other people 's children and not get paid for it ?
as it turned out , many would . various women between the ages of 45 and 76 have contacted hansen .
most of them are single mothers , widowed or divorced , have grown-up children and are retired but still looking to keep themselves busy . experience over youth michaela hansen got married and became a mother at a young age , which is why she never had the chance to work as an au-pair abroad herself .
now she is nearly 50 and already a grandmother , with her second grandchild due in the fall .
she works as an independent pr consultant . it was a television show that gave hansen the idea of sending grandmothers abroad to work as nannies .
" why should only young women do this ? " she thought .
after all , older people can often do a better job because they have more experience in dealing with children - and they can cook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansen encourages women like herself to take a risk since the beginning of the year hansen has been running her business , granny aupair , which has been well received .
several hundred women have already contacted her , 100 of them have signed up , and 10 have already been placed with families . hansen promotes her business via german cultural institutes , but she has also attracted the attention of foreign media , resulting in enquiries from families in various countries .
she compares her steadily rising success to a stone thrown into the water , which is " now making ripples . " " i have received emails from hawaii , from australia , from mexico , spain , england , " said hansen .
" i 'm noticing now that it 's going from country to country and becoming more and more well-known . " adventure abroad sixty-two-year-old anke brand has already started packing her suitcase : on october 1 , she ’ ll be heading off to london to stay with a family there .
she used to work as the director of a nursing home and has spent a lot of time in the last years looking after her granddaughter .
now she is semi-retired , feels fit and healthy , and has an urge to do something new . when she read about granny aupair , she immediately knew that it was the right thing for her and that living abroad for a year .
she said she never would have thought of the idea herself , but the adventure was just what she needed . brand was open to the idea of going anywhere abroad and ended up choosing a family in london .

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

however , the headline-grabbing trial was halted before it could really begin . the trial of nine men accused of forming a child porn ring was postponed on the first day in court wednesday .
the local criminal court in the central german city of darmstadt decided to postpone the trial until september 30 , after a defense lawyer accused one of the public assessors of the case of being biased against the defendants .
in the german judicial system , judges hearing trials at a regional state level are often assisted by two members of the public who sit on the bench with the judge and help in assessing the evidence .
the defense accused one of the assessors of having been overheard making prejudiced remarks about the defendants before the trial .
judges uninvolved with the case ordered the assessor to be dismissed .
criminal organization police describe the case as germany 's " biggest-ever crackdown on child porn on the web . "
the nine men , aged from 30 to 58 , are accused of distributing pornographic pictures and videos of children in private chat rooms between 2006 and 2009 .
the charges against the men , who come from all over germany , involve the forming of a " criminal organization " to swap obscene images .
police say they discovered up to 100,000 such images , many involving violence , on the men 's computers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.09.2010 lehman insider lashes out at top management , government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' bankruptcy shook financial markets a bank needed to fail in order to push the banking rescue program through the us senate , lehman brothers insider lawrence mcdonald says .
his company was the scapegoat . september 2008 saw the financial crisis reach its apex .
merrill lynch was sold to bank of america .
mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac were rescued by the government .
and in the early hours of monday september 15 , famed investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy . lawrence mcdonald worked as a trading vice president on the third floor of the 158-year-old institution .
in 2009 he published an insider ’ s account of the lehman failure : " a colossal failure of common sense : the inside story of the collapse of lehman brothers , " which has now been translated into german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawrence mcdonald worked on lehman brothers ' trading floor ' i watched giants weep ' two years after the bank 's failure , mcdonald spoke to deutsche welle about the events that took place . " you remember the days of the summer of 2008 - holding out hope .
hope , hope , hope , " he said .
" we thought we would be the last wall street bank that was left alone to die .
and we thought that right up to the end . " when compiling material for his book , mcdonald didn ’ t just rely on his own memories , but on interviews with his co-workers as well . " it was like watching giants weep , " he said .
many of the people he interviewed had been with the firm for decades , and many had lost a large part of their wealth when the firm went under . " i sat down with person after person , broken men , broken women .
hearts crushed , lives really thrown in tatters . " bildunterschrift : the 158-year-old institution took the rap for what many others had done as well , the author says harsh criticism of leadership mcdonald argues that it was not the lehman brothers employees who were unscrupulous bankers - it was the leadership that ruined the firm . " lehman brothers was never rotten at the core , she was rotten at the head , " mcdonald said .
" picture in your mind a rocket ship , 3000 feet high : at the top there is a capsule .
and in the capsule there are some astronauts from the 1980s .
but inside the rocket there is 21st century fuel , 21st century technology , 21st century power . " in other words : the bosses were out of touch .
mcdonald is particularly critical of former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld , who he said was never seen on the third floor by traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-lehman ceo richard fuld ignored warnings , mcdonald says " the 31st floor at lehman brothers should have been the nerve center of a 750 billion dollar hedge fund , which is what lehman had become , " mcdonald said .
“ they were just consumed with growth , consumed with globalization " and missed any signs that might have shown problems lay ahead . a fateful moment ? for those on the trading floor , signs that something was wrong were visible as early as 2006 .
but when an insider tried to inform the bosses of a problem , he was fired a few weeks later , mcdonald said . mcdonald blames fuld for not wanting to hear about problems - not even from then-treasury secretary henry paulson .
he said paulson , who spent years working at goldman sachs as fuld 's competition , tried to warn the lehman boss at a meeting in the summer of 2008 . " at the dinner paulson was saying to our ceo , ' listen , you guys have to reduce risk .
we just saved bear stearns , this is getting worse , you need to really clean up your act . '
and at one point our ceo slammed the fork down on his plate and he said : ' i 've been in my seat a lot longer than you were at yours at goldman sachs .
do n't tell me how to do my job . " ' that is the moment that could have sealed lehman 's fate , mcdonald says today . drowning - and watching the bubbles other banks - including aig , bear stearns and merill lynch - invested in the same products and made the same mistakes as lehman brothers , mcdonald said .
when the government saw banking chaos headed its way , it decided to sacrifice one institution in order to get the senate to pass the planned banking rescue package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a dinner , henry paulson tried to warn the ceo " our secretary hank paulson , our government , they took lehman brothers ' head , they put it under water – and then watched the bubbles , " mcdonald said . today , banks are in better shape than they were two years ago .
their balance sheets are cleaned up , and they carry less risk .
" not because of finance reform , but out of fear , " mcdonald said . two years after the fact , there are still hearings taking place before congress and investigations meant to shed light on the darkness - and to finger the guilty parties . but according to mcdonald , us efforts to assign blame for the banking system failure have n't gone far enough .
germany has done a better job , he said . " the sec has actually been embarrassed because in germany the ceo of ikb bank is facing criminal charges , ” he said .
“ it looks like he might go to jail for comments he made on a conference call back in 2007 .
and in the united states , we had ceos - including our executives at lehman brothers - some of them that did the same thing and nobody is facing jail time .
that is wrong . " author : miriam braun -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concept has developed into a unique and successful business . her female friends loved the idea immediately , says michaela hansen , but the men were skeptical .
who , after all , could possibly want to look after other people 's children and not get paid for it ?
as it turned out , many would . various women between the ages of 45 and 76 have contacted hansen .
most of them are single mothers , widowed or divorced , have grown-up children and are retired but still looking to keep themselves busy . experience over youth michaela hansen got married and became a mother at a young age , which is why she never had the chance to work as an au-pair abroad herself .
now she is nearly 50 and already a grandmother , with her second grandchild due in the fall .
she works as an independent pr consultant . it was a television show that gave hansen the idea of sending grandmothers abroad to work as nannies .
" why should only young women do this ? " she thought .
after all , older people can often do a better job because they have more experience in dealing with children - and they can cook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hansen encourages women like herself to take a risk since the beginning of the year hansen has been running her business , granny aupair , which has been well received .
several hundred women have already contacted her , 100 of them have signed up , and 10 have already been placed with families . hansen promotes her business via german cultural institutes , but she has also attracted the attention of foreign media , resulting in enquiries from families in various countries .
she compares her steadily rising success to a stone thrown into the water , which is " now making ripples . " " i have received emails from hawaii , from australia , from mexico , spain , england , " said hansen .
" i 'm noticing now that it 's going from country to country and becoming more and more well-known . " adventure abroad sixty-two-year-old anke brand has already started packing her suitcase : on october 1 , she ’ ll be heading off to london to stay with a family there .
she used to work as the director of a nursing home and has spent a lot of time in the last years looking after her granddaughter .
now she is semi-retired , feels fit and healthy , and has an urge to do something new . when she read about granny aupair , she immediately knew that it was the right thing for her and that living abroad for a year .
she said she never would have thought of the idea herself , but the adventure was just what she needed . brand was open to the idea of going anywhere abroad and ended up choosing a family in london .
she is going to look after a two-year-old girl and has already visited the family for an initial meeting .
brand will have her own bedroom and share a bathroom with the young daughter .
she is allowed to have visitors , too , and her husband already has plans to come .
working for accommodation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids often benefit from having a more mature nanny the au-pairs do not receive a wage but work to cover the costs of their accommodation .
hansen emphasizes that her business is not an employment agency .
the host families sometimes finance their au-pairs ' language lessons and some even offer pocket money , but these are individual arrangements . contrary to ordinary , young au-pairs , whose rights and obligations are firmly established before their work begins , these women negotiate agreements with their host families themselves .
hansen thinks that this is a good set-up and says that older women are better able to speak up if they 're not happy brand feels confident about her upcoming au-pair job and does not worry about any potential conflicts .
after all , she believes most problems can be sorted out by talking about them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.09.2010 lehman insider lashes out at top management , government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' bankruptcy shook financial markets a bank needed to fail in order to push the banking rescue program through the us senate , lehman brothers insider lawrence mcdonald says .
his company was the scapegoat . september 2008 saw the financial crisis reach its apex .
merrill lynch was sold to bank of america .
mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac were rescued by the government .
and in the early hours of monday september 15 , famed investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy . lawrence mcdonald worked as a trading vice president on the third floor of the 158-year-old institution .
in 2009 he published an insider ’ s account of the lehman failure : " a colossal failure of common sense : the inside story of the collapse of lehman brothers , " which has now been translated into german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawrence mcdonald worked on lehman brothers ' trading floor ' i watched giants weep ' two years after the bank 's failure , mcdonald spoke to deutsche welle about the events that took place . " you remember the days of the summer of 2008 - holding out hope .
hope , hope , hope , " he said .
" we thought we would be the last wall street bank that was left alone to die .
and we thought that right up to the end . " when compiling material for his book , mcdonald didn ’ t just rely on his own memories , but on interviews with his co-workers as well . " it was like watching giants weep , " he said .
many of the people he interviewed had been with the firm for decades , and many had lost a large part of their wealth when the firm went under . " i sat down with person after person , broken men , broken women .
hearts crushed , lives really thrown in tatters . " bildunterschrift : the 158-year-old institution took the rap for what many others had done as well , the author says harsh criticism of leadership mcdonald argues that it was not the lehman brothers employees who were unscrupulous bankers - it was the leadership that ruined the firm . " lehman brothers was never rotten at the core , she was rotten at the head , " mcdonald said .
" picture in your mind a rocket ship , 3000 feet high : at the top there is a capsule .
and in the capsule there are some astronauts from the 1980s .
but inside the rocket there is 21st century fuel , 21st century technology , 21st century power . " in other words : the bosses were out of touch .
mcdonald is particularly critical of former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld , who he said was never seen on the third floor by traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-lehman ceo richard fuld ignored warnings , mcdonald says " the 31st floor at lehman brothers should have been the nerve center of a 750 billion dollar hedge fund , which is what lehman had become , " mcdonald said .
“ they were just consumed with growth , consumed with globalization " and missed any signs that might have shown problems lay ahead . a fateful moment ? for those on the trading floor , signs that something was wrong were visible as early as 2006 .
but when an insider tried to inform the bosses of a problem , he was fired a few weeks later , mcdonald said . mcdonald blames fuld for not wanting to hear about problems - not even from then-treasury secretary henry paulson .
he said paulson , who spent years working at goldman sachs as fuld 's competition , tried to warn the lehman boss at a meeting in the summer of 2008 . " at the dinner paulson was saying to our ceo , ' listen , you guys have to reduce risk .
we just saved bear stearns , this is getting worse , you need to really clean up your act . '
and at one point our ceo slammed the fork down on his plate and he said : ' i 've been in my seat a lot longer than you were at yours at goldman sachs .
do n't tell me how to do my job . " ' that is the moment that could have sealed lehman 's fate , mcdonald says today . drowning - and watching the bubbles other banks - including aig , bear stearns and merill lynch - invested in the same products and made the same mistakes as lehman brothers , mcdonald said .
when the government saw banking chaos headed its way , it decided to sacrifice one institution in order to get the senate to pass the planned banking rescue package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a dinner , henry paulson tried to warn the ceo " our secretary hank paulson , our government , they took lehman brothers ' head , they put it under water – and then watched the bubbles , " mcdonald said . today , banks are in better shape than they were two years ago .
their balance sheets are cleaned up , and they carry less risk .
" not because of finance reform , but out of fear , " mcdonald said . two years after the fact , there are still hearings taking place before congress and investigations meant to shed light on the darkness - and to finger the guilty parties . but according to mcdonald , us efforts to assign blame for the banking system failure have n't gone far enough .
germany has done a better job , he said . " the sec has actually been embarrassed because in germany the ceo of ikb bank is facing criminal charges , ” he said .
“ it looks like he might go to jail for comments he made on a conference call back in 2007 .
and in the united states , we had ceos - including our executives at lehman brothers - some of them that did the same thing and nobody is facing jail time .
that is wrong . " author : miriam braun -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 15.09.2010 czech republic stops google from further street view photography großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google 's street view is used daily by millions of europeans czech data protection authorities refused google 's second attempt to resume street view photos , however , photos that are already online will remain .
inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

they can not stand up for their beliefs , because it may be seen as not politically correct or they just do n't want to step on some toes . - stefaye , us the niqab is the right of every muslim woman . - mohamed , ethiopia every person must respect the law of every country .
for example , the women who wear the burqa have to be respectful of the laws of france . - hector , colombia muslims all over the world have been wearing headscarves for years , so why the sudden interest now ?
how does a scarf hurt anyone ?
muslim women and nuns wear scarves as a sign of their faith .
originally christians were also told to cover their heads when entering a church .
i am a muslim woman , i have lots of non-muslim friends and i have a german fiance , yet none of them judged me by my dress and instead got to know me as a person .
covering of the face i can understand people disliking , as your identity is hidden , but seriously , what is wrong with a scarf ?

the law was passed in parliament with an overwhelming vote in favor of the ban . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

i think the burqa is disrespectful to the customs , traditions of a host country or adopted one .
i applaud the decision .
although many more countries feel the same as france and belgium , they are afraid to do something about it .
they can not stand up for their beliefs , because it may be seen as not politically correct or they just do n't want to step on some toes . - stefaye , us the niqab is the right of every muslim woman . - mohamed , ethiopia every person must respect the law of every country .
for example , the women who wear the burqa have to be respectful of the laws of france . - hector , colombia muslims all over the world have been wearing headscarves for years , so why the sudden interest now ?
how does a scarf hurt anyone ?
muslim women and nuns wear scarves as a sign of their faith .
originally christians were also told to cover their heads when entering a church .
i am a muslim woman , i have lots of non-muslim friends and i have a german fiance , yet none of them judged me by my dress and instead got to know me as a person .
covering of the face i can understand people disliking , as your identity is hidden , but seriously , what is wrong with a scarf ?
is n't germany , or france , proud to be multicultural , proud to have different people of different skin ?
should n't a person be judged by their personality and behavior ? - sana , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .

" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.09.2010 lehman insider lashes out at top management , government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' bankruptcy shook financial markets a bank needed to fail in order to push the banking rescue program through the us senate , lehman brothers insider lawrence mcdonald says .
his company was the scapegoat . september 2008 saw the financial crisis reach its apex .
merrill lynch was sold to bank of america .
mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac were rescued by the government .
and in the early hours of monday september 15 , famed investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy . lawrence mcdonald worked as a trading vice president on the third floor of the 158-year-old institution .
in 2009 he published an insider ’ s account of the lehman failure : " a colossal failure of common sense : the inside story of the collapse of lehman brothers , " which has now been translated into german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawrence mcdonald worked on lehman brothers ' trading floor ' i watched giants weep ' two years after the bank 's failure , mcdonald spoke to deutsche welle about the events that took place . " you remember the days of the summer of 2008 - holding out hope .
hope , hope , hope , " he said .
" we thought we would be the last wall street bank that was left alone to die .
and we thought that right up to the end . " when compiling material for his book , mcdonald didn ’ t just rely on his own memories , but on interviews with his co-workers as well . " it was like watching giants weep , " he said .
many of the people he interviewed had been with the firm for decades , and many had lost a large part of their wealth when the firm went under . " i sat down with person after person , broken men , broken women .
hearts crushed , lives really thrown in tatters . " bildunterschrift : the 158-year-old institution took the rap for what many others had done as well , the author says harsh criticism of leadership mcdonald argues that it was not the lehman brothers employees who were unscrupulous bankers - it was the leadership that ruined the firm . " lehman brothers was never rotten at the core , she was rotten at the head , " mcdonald said .
" picture in your mind a rocket ship , 3000 feet high : at the top there is a capsule .
and in the capsule there are some astronauts from the 1980s .
but inside the rocket there is 21st century fuel , 21st century technology , 21st century power . " in other words : the bosses were out of touch .
mcdonald is particularly critical of former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld , who he said was never seen on the third floor by traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-lehman ceo richard fuld ignored warnings , mcdonald says " the 31st floor at lehman brothers should have been the nerve center of a 750 billion dollar hedge fund , which is what lehman had become , " mcdonald said .
“ they were just consumed with growth , consumed with globalization " and missed any signs that might have shown problems lay ahead . a fateful moment ? for those on the trading floor , signs that something was wrong were visible as early as 2006 .
but when an insider tried to inform the bosses of a problem , he was fired a few weeks later , mcdonald said . mcdonald blames fuld for not wanting to hear about problems - not even from then-treasury secretary henry paulson .
he said paulson , who spent years working at goldman sachs as fuld 's competition , tried to warn the lehman boss at a meeting in the summer of 2008 . " at the dinner paulson was saying to our ceo , ' listen , you guys have to reduce risk .
we just saved bear stearns , this is getting worse , you need to really clean up your act . '
and at one point our ceo slammed the fork down on his plate and he said : ' i 've been in my seat a lot longer than you were at yours at goldman sachs .
do n't tell me how to do my job . " ' that is the moment that could have sealed lehman 's fate , mcdonald says today . drowning - and watching the bubbles other banks - including aig , bear stearns and merill lynch - invested in the same products and made the same mistakes as lehman brothers , mcdonald said .
when the government saw banking chaos headed its way , it decided to sacrifice one institution in order to get the senate to pass the planned banking rescue package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a dinner , henry paulson tried to warn the ceo " our secretary hank paulson , our government , they took lehman brothers ' head , they put it under water – and then watched the bubbles , " mcdonald said . today , banks are in better shape than they were two years ago .
their balance sheets are cleaned up , and they carry less risk .
" not because of finance reform , but out of fear , " mcdonald said . two years after the fact , there are still hearings taking place before congress and investigations meant to shed light on the darkness - and to finger the guilty parties . but according to mcdonald , us efforts to assign blame for the banking system failure have n't gone far enough .
germany has done a better job , he said . " the sec has actually been embarrassed because in germany the ceo of ikb bank is facing criminal charges , ” he said .
“ it looks like he might go to jail for comments he made on a conference call back in 2007 .
and in the united states , we had ceos - including our executives at lehman brothers - some of them that did the same thing and nobody is facing jail time .
that is wrong . " author : miriam braun -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.09.2010 lehman insider lashes out at top management , government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehman brothers ' bankruptcy shook financial markets a bank needed to fail in order to push the banking rescue program through the us senate , lehman brothers insider lawrence mcdonald says .
his company was the scapegoat . september 2008 saw the financial crisis reach its apex .
merrill lynch was sold to bank of america .
mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac were rescued by the government .
and in the early hours of monday september 15 , famed investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy . lawrence mcdonald worked as a trading vice president on the third floor of the 158-year-old institution .
in 2009 he published an insider ’ s account of the lehman failure : " a colossal failure of common sense : the inside story of the collapse of lehman brothers , " which has now been translated into german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawrence mcdonald worked on lehman brothers ' trading floor ' i watched giants weep ' two years after the bank 's failure , mcdonald spoke to deutsche welle about the events that took place . " you remember the days of the summer of 2008 - holding out hope .
hope , hope , hope , " he said .
" we thought we would be the last wall street bank that was left alone to die .
and we thought that right up to the end . " when compiling material for his book , mcdonald didn ’ t just rely on his own memories , but on interviews with his co-workers as well . " it was like watching giants weep , " he said .
many of the people he interviewed had been with the firm for decades , and many had lost a large part of their wealth when the firm went under . " i sat down with person after person , broken men , broken women .
hearts crushed , lives really thrown in tatters . " bildunterschrift : the 158-year-old institution took the rap for what many others had done as well , the author says harsh criticism of leadership mcdonald argues that it was not the lehman brothers employees who were unscrupulous bankers - it was the leadership that ruined the firm . " lehman brothers was never rotten at the core , she was rotten at the head , " mcdonald said .
" picture in your mind a rocket ship , 3000 feet high : at the top there is a capsule .
and in the capsule there are some astronauts from the 1980s .
but inside the rocket there is 21st century fuel , 21st century technology , 21st century power . " in other words : the bosses were out of touch .
mcdonald is particularly critical of former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld , who he said was never seen on the third floor by traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-lehman ceo richard fuld ignored warnings , mcdonald says " the 31st floor at lehman brothers should have been the nerve center of a 750 billion dollar hedge fund , which is what lehman had become , " mcdonald said .
“ they were just consumed with growth , consumed with globalization " and missed any signs that might have shown problems lay ahead . a fateful moment ? for those on the trading floor , signs that something was wrong were visible as early as 2006 .
but when an insider tried to inform the bosses of a problem , he was fired a few weeks later , mcdonald said . mcdonald blames fuld for not wanting to hear about problems - not even from then-treasury secretary henry paulson .
he said paulson , who spent years working at goldman sachs as fuld 's competition , tried to warn the lehman boss at a meeting in the summer of 2008 . " at the dinner paulson was saying to our ceo , ' listen , you guys have to reduce risk .
we just saved bear stearns , this is getting worse , you need to really clean up your act . '
and at one point our ceo slammed the fork down on his plate and he said : ' i 've been in my seat a lot longer than you were at yours at goldman sachs .
do n't tell me how to do my job . " ' that is the moment that could have sealed lehman 's fate , mcdonald says today . drowning - and watching the bubbles other banks - including aig , bear stearns and merill lynch - invested in the same products and made the same mistakes as lehman brothers , mcdonald said .
when the government saw banking chaos headed its way , it decided to sacrifice one institution in order to get the senate to pass the planned banking rescue package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a dinner , henry paulson tried to warn the ceo " our secretary hank paulson , our government , they took lehman brothers ' head , they put it under water – and then watched the bubbles , " mcdonald said . today , banks are in better shape than they were two years ago .
their balance sheets are cleaned up , and they carry less risk .
" not because of finance reform , but out of fear , " mcdonald said . two years after the fact , there are still hearings taking place before congress and investigations meant to shed light on the darkness - and to finger the guilty parties . but according to mcdonald , us efforts to assign blame for the banking system failure have n't gone far enough .
germany has done a better job , he said . " the sec has actually been embarrassed because in germany the ceo of ikb bank is facing criminal charges , ” he said .
“ it looks like he might go to jail for comments he made on a conference call back in 2007 .
and in the united states , we had ceos - including our executives at lehman brothers - some of them that did the same thing and nobody is facing jail time .
that is wrong . " author : miriam braun -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i think the burqa is disrespectful to the customs , traditions of a host country or adopted one .
i applaud the decision .
although many more countries feel the same as france and belgium , they are afraid to do something about it .
they can not stand up for their beliefs , because it may be seen as not politically correct or they just do n't want to step on some toes . - stefaye , us the niqab is the right of every muslim woman . - mohamed , ethiopia every person must respect the law of every country .
for example , the women who wear the burqa have to be respectful of the laws of france . - hector , colombia muslims all over the world have been wearing headscarves for years , so why the sudden interest now ?
how does a scarf hurt anyone ?
muslim women and nuns wear scarves as a sign of their faith .
originally christians were also told to cover their heads when entering a church .
i am a muslim woman , i have lots of non-muslim friends and i have a german fiance , yet none of them judged me by my dress and instead got to know me as a person .
covering of the face i can understand people disliking , as your identity is hidden , but seriously , what is wrong with a scarf ?

however , the headline-grabbing trial was halted before it could really begin . the trial of nine men accused of forming a child porn ring was postponed on the first day in court wednesday .
the local criminal court in the central german city of darmstadt decided to postpone the trial until september 30 , after a defense lawyer accused one of the public assessors of the case of being biased against the defendants .
in the german judicial system , judges hearing trials at a regional state level are often assisted by two members of the public who sit on the bench with the judge and help in assessing the evidence .
the defense accused one of the assessors of having been overheard making prejudiced remarks about the defendants before the trial .
judges uninvolved with the case ordered the assessor to be dismissed .
criminal organization police describe the case as germany 's " biggest-ever crackdown on child porn on the web . "
the nine men , aged from 30 to 58 , are accused of distributing pornographic pictures and videos of children in private chat rooms between 2006 and 2009 .
the charges against the men , who come from all over germany , involve the forming of a " criminal organization " to swap obscene images .
police say they discovered up to 100,000 such images , many involving violence , on the men 's computers .
two of the nine defendants are also charged with raping minors .
after this delay , the trial is expected to last roughly three months .

however , the headline-grabbing trial was halted before it could really begin . the trial of nine men accused of forming a child porn ring was postponed on the first day in court wednesday .
the local criminal court in the central german city of darmstadt decided to postpone the trial until september 30 , after a defense lawyer accused one of the public assessors of the case of being biased against the defendants .
in the german judicial system , judges hearing trials at a regional state level are often assisted by two members of the public who sit on the bench with the judge and help in assessing the evidence .
the defense accused one of the assessors of having been overheard making prejudiced remarks about the defendants before the trial .
judges uninvolved with the case ordered the assessor to be dismissed .
criminal organization police describe the case as germany 's " biggest-ever crackdown on child porn on the web . "
the nine men , aged from 30 to 58 , are accused of distributing pornographic pictures and videos of children in private chat rooms between 2006 and 2009 .
the charges against the men , who come from all over germany , involve the forming of a " criminal organization " to swap obscene images .
police say they discovered up to 100,000 such images , many involving violence , on the men 's computers .
two of the nine defendants are also charged with raping minors .
after this delay , the trial is expected to last roughly three months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 15.09.2010 perverted family traditions often play a role in modern-day slavery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estimates of the number of slaves around the world run from 27 to 200 million slavery remains a scourge in many parts of the world , with the victims often being children .
deutsche welle investigates what modern slavery means and takes a look at cases where kids are being enslaved . depending on how the term is defined , as many 230 million people around the globe are virtual slaves .
the us state department , for instance , defines modern slavery to include various forms of forced labor , involuntary domestic servitude , sex trafficking and child soldiers . american sociologist kevin bales is probably the world 's foremost expert on slavery .
he puts the number of enslaved people at 27 million - and that 's using a narrow definition . " this is about people who can not walk away , who are forced to work without pay and who are operating 24/7 under the threat of violence , " bales said in highly publicized public lecture earlier this year .
" it 's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history . " twenty-seven million , bales says , is more than double the number of people bought and sold in the transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th century . the difference in modern-day slavery , he added , is the drastic drop in prices paid for slaves , with the world average being $ 90 -lrb- 70 euros -rrb- . " people have ceased to be a capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups , " bales said . of those 27 million , around 10 million are probably children , says volker bajus from the german human rights group terres des hommes .
he adds , however , that because of poverty some 100 to 120 million children work in situations that can hardly be described as volitional . and as two examples show , cultural traditions concerning family labor are often warped to support extreme forms of human exploitation . kazakh tobacco bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child labor happens not just in kazakhstan , but in more western nations such as turkey the humanitarian organization human rights watch spent two years monitoring the tobacco fields near the city of almaty in kazakhstan .
in a report published this summer , entitled " hellish work : explotation of migrant tobacco workers in kazakhstan , " the group says it found children as young as 10 working there . some of this labor is paid , says the report , while other work is not .
in particular , young immigrants and refugees from the troubled neighboring country of kyrgyzstan are vulnerable to exploitation . " children arrive together with the adult migrants , and they enjoy even less protection than their parents , " human rights activist zulfiya baisakova told deutsche welle . kazakhstan is a former republic of the soviet union , where it was customary for children to work alongside their parents to help bring in the harvest .
sadly , this tradition has been warped to support what may amount to child slavery . " the amazing thing is that according to the children 's answers to questions we ask , at least half of the parents view the practice positively , " said ajunur zhakupova from the almaty office for child protection . the tobacco harvested by these children is used by western companies such as philip morris . fish in ghana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often used for domestic labor and more dangerous tasks another case of child labor that has attracted a recent attention is fishing in ghana .
although ghanaian law prohibits people under eighteen from engaging in hazardous labor , the practice is widespread , and the conditions often horrific . " trafficked children are sometimes forced to work up to 14 hours a day , and seven days a week amid beatings , " a report commissioned by germany 's madamfo ghana human rights group concluded about two fishing communities in the kpano dictrict .
" sometimes these children drown when they get entangled in the nets or are pulled into the water by big fishes that are trapped in the nets .
some other times , they drown in the initial process of diving because they are not well-trained . " the report notes that the fishermen do n't use their own children for such work but bring in others from other locations .
tragically , say human rights groups , such stories are not rare in africa . " africa has the highest percentage of child labor , and it 's prevalent in western africa , " volker bajus told deutsche welle .
" children work in cocoa plantations and do domestic labor , and it looks as though they are often trafficked . " bajus added the cost of procuring what is essentially a child slave can be around 50 euros . knowledge around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese authorities discovered slave laborers in 2007 there have also been well-documented cases in recent years of children being forced to do dangerous work in brick kilns in india and china .
yet the negative publicity generated forced some improvements and represents a ray of hope for the future . " the key is education and a will on the part of governments and among the middle classes to fight against people being indentured and enslaved by debts , " bajus said .
" india is a good example , and as a rule , this is happening in the emerging nations . " knowledge can be a tool for liberating people from unnecessarily dire conditions . " exploitation is often based on people not knowing their rights or not being able to calculate whether they are being paid proper wages because they are illiterate , " bajus added .
" education and a good social infrastructure help prevent such abuses . " ironically , globalization is often a factor encouraging modern-day slavery , but the possibilities it opens up for educating people around the world about such exploitation may also be part of the ultimate solution to the problem . zulfiya baisakova and ajunur zhakupova were interviewed by dw 's olga korneeva and tatiana petrenko . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

germany has a rapidly aging population , and the cost of caring for the elderly is growing .
a court has confirmed that there is a legal obligation in germany for people to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care . germans have a legal duty to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care once the individual 's own funds are exhausted .
the federal court of justice in karlsruhe upheld this law on wednesday and ordered a man to pay 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 52,000 -rrb- to his local authority for his deceased mother 's care home fees .
the woman , who had been living in a care home in gelsenkirchen for five years , had had no contact with her son for over 30 years .
her mental health problems had meant he had lived with his father from the age of 12 .
against this background , the son was unwilling to accept that he should pay for his mother 's care .
" i did n't have any quality of childhood , " he told broadcaster ard before the ruling . " i ca n't pay , and i 'm not prepared to do so .
especially because there was such a long period of time when i did n't have any contact at all .
i did n't even know the woman was still alive . "
who should foot the bill ?
there are already limits on the amount that children can be asked to contribute to their parents ' care .
in principle no one should have to cut back on their current standard of living to pay for the cost of a care home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly people worry about how to pay for the care they need .
but andrea weskamm of the german nurses association thinks children should n't have to bear any financial responsibility for their parents whatsoever .
" what happens with people who do n't have any children ? "
weskamm said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the state jumps in .
it 's also unfair for those people who have parents with serious needs .
i think it 's up to the whole of society to deal with this problem . "
but should the state really be expected to foot the bill for the already enormous – and growing - cost of caring for the elderly ?
according to weskamm , many people are concerned about putting a financial burden on their families as they grow older : " parents worry about what will become of them , there 's a lot of uncertainty , " weskamm said .
" they ask themselves whether they 'll have to go into a home if it gets to the point that they need outside help .
and they worry about who 'll pay for it . "
even if insurance companies cover some of the cost of going into a care home , they are unlikely to pay for everything .
with well over 600,000 people in 11,000 care homes in germany today , many families will be unsettled by the karlsruhe court ruling .

germany has a rapidly aging population , and the cost of caring for the elderly is growing .
a court has confirmed that there is a legal obligation in germany for people to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care . germans have a legal duty to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care once the individual 's own funds are exhausted .
the federal court of justice in karlsruhe upheld this law on wednesday and ordered a man to pay 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 52,000 -rrb- to his local authority for his deceased mother 's care home fees .
the woman , who had been living in a care home in gelsenkirchen for five years , had had no contact with her son for over 30 years .
her mental health problems had meant he had lived with his father from the age of 12 .
against this background , the son was unwilling to accept that he should pay for his mother 's care .
" i did n't have any quality of childhood , " he told broadcaster ard before the ruling . " i ca n't pay , and i 'm not prepared to do so .
especially because there was such a long period of time when i did n't have any contact at all .
i did n't even know the woman was still alive . "
who should foot the bill ?
there are already limits on the amount that children can be asked to contribute to their parents ' care .
in principle no one should have to cut back on their current standard of living to pay for the cost of a care home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly people worry about how to pay for the care they need .
but andrea weskamm of the german nurses association thinks children should n't have to bear any financial responsibility for their parents whatsoever .
" what happens with people who do n't have any children ? "
weskamm said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the state jumps in .
it 's also unfair for those people who have parents with serious needs .
i think it 's up to the whole of society to deal with this problem . "
but should the state really be expected to foot the bill for the already enormous – and growing - cost of caring for the elderly ?
according to weskamm , many people are concerned about putting a financial burden on their families as they grow older : " parents worry about what will become of them , there 's a lot of uncertainty , " weskamm said .
" they ask themselves whether they 'll have to go into a home if it gets to the point that they need outside help .
and they worry about who 'll pay for it . "
even if insurance companies cover some of the cost of going into a care home , they are unlikely to pay for everything .
with well over 600,000 people in 11,000 care homes in germany today , many families will be unsettled by the karlsruhe court ruling .

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

germany has a rapidly aging population , and the cost of caring for the elderly is growing .
a court has confirmed that there is a legal obligation in germany for people to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care . germans have a legal duty to contribute to the cost of their parents ' care once the individual 's own funds are exhausted .
the federal court of justice in karlsruhe upheld this law on wednesday and ordered a man to pay 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 52,000 -rrb- to his local authority for his deceased mother 's care home fees .
the woman , who had been living in a care home in gelsenkirchen for five years , had had no contact with her son for over 30 years .
her mental health problems had meant he had lived with his father from the age of 12 .
against this background , the son was unwilling to accept that he should pay for his mother 's care .
" i did n't have any quality of childhood , " he told broadcaster ard before the ruling . " i ca n't pay , and i 'm not prepared to do so .
especially because there was such a long period of time when i did n't have any contact at all .
i did n't even know the woman was still alive . "
who should foot the bill ?
there are already limits on the amount that children can be asked to contribute to their parents ' care .
in principle no one should have to cut back on their current standard of living to pay for the cost of a care home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly people worry about how to pay for the care they need .
but andrea weskamm of the german nurses association thinks children should n't have to bear any financial responsibility for their parents whatsoever .
" what happens with people who do n't have any children ? "
weskamm said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the state jumps in .
it 's also unfair for those people who have parents with serious needs .
i think it 's up to the whole of society to deal with this problem . "
but should the state really be expected to foot the bill for the already enormous – and growing - cost of caring for the elderly ?
according to weskamm , many people are concerned about putting a financial burden on their families as they grow older : " parents worry about what will become of them , there 's a lot of uncertainty , " weskamm said .
" they ask themselves whether they 'll have to go into a home if it gets to the point that they need outside help .
and they worry about who 'll pay for it . "
even if insurance companies cover some of the cost of going into a care home , they are unlikely to pay for everything .
with well over 600,000 people in 11,000 care homes in germany today , many families will be unsettled by the karlsruhe court ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 15.09.2010 danish amateur rocket organization regroups after failed launch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket , tycho brahe , was named after the famed 16th-century danish astronomer copenhagen suborbitals launch from the baltic sea failed after a hairdryer was left unplugged , which was meant to blow hot air at a valve .
the group now says it will re-schedule the same test launch for june 2011 . ten days ago , a danish team of amateur rocket scientists tried to launch the world 's first amateur space-rocket from a platform in the baltic sea , but it did n't go quite as expected .
the launch failed .
after years of research and planning , copenhagen suborbitals , was understandably disappointed when the launch failed .
the team is now re-evaluating its future plans and figuring out where to go from here .
kristian von bengtson , one of two leaders of the group organizing the launch , copenhagen suborbitals , is a former nasa scientist .
he was the one directing the operation , and the one to push the launch button .
" well i pushed the button when we came to t-zero meaning that the rocket was supposed to actually launch from sealevel - -lsb- but -rsb- nothing happened " , von bengtson told deutsche welle .
he explained that after careful examination , the main valve of the rocket booster failed .
had it worked properly , the high-pressurized liquid oxygen in the partly-solid fuel , part-liquid oxygen hybrid engine should have blasted through the rocket 's fuel to ignite the rocket .
the problem occurred when a regular hairdryer was left unplugged for several minutes before launch .
the hairdryer was meant to fire hot air at a valve to keep it from freezing under minus 180-degree celsius liquid oxygen .
using unconventional materials is one of the key elements in the build of this danish amateur rocket .
this approach has helped the team keeping costs down , being able to produce a full scale rocket and spaceship for about 50,000 euros or about $ 65,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter madsen and kristian von bengtson , founders of copenhagen suborbitals , say they will attempt another launch next year lessons learned " next step is the evaluation , we need to have on paper what we learned , especially at sea because a maritime operation is very difficult , " von bengtson said . " we have a lot of lessons learned and the list is like , meters long .
it goes all the way from the rocket , the technicals to personal issues and how to transport people at sea . "
despite this setback , von bengtson is trying to stay positive , given the huge amount of coordination involved when working at sea .
he even had to temporarily close the airspace over that part of the baltic sea .
" so it 's a huge operation and just being able to build the rocket and bring it into sea and having this huge organization which actually carried out the launch attempt was a success itself , " he added .
success is ' possible ' and while that might sound like mere whitewashing , the fact that this group of amateurs actually got so close to launching a rocket is pretty impressive , astronomy experts say .
" the first time i heard about this project , my immediate reaction was these guys are mad , " said steen eiler joergensen , the president of the danish astronautical society .
" but the more i looked at the details in the project the more it dawned upon me what they are trying to do is actually in principle , possible .
obviously it 's gonna take a lot of hard work and it 's going to take many more years before they can put a man on top of that rocket . "
but for now , copenhagen suborbitals is setting a more modest goal .
they want to reach a suborbital flight - 100 kilometers into the air , just short of reaching orbit .
the failed test launch was designed to go only a maximum of 30 kilometers in the air .
of course , nasa and other major space agencies have been doing manned spaceflights for decades - the technology has n't changed that much over the past few decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the rocket launched , this doppler radar was meant to track its flight path but peter madsen , another one of copenhagen suborbitals ' leaders and the constructor of the rocket booster , says that space agency bureaucracy is precisely what is slowing down space programs around the world .
" when i hear the time schedules of modern spaceflight , when they talk about returning to the moon in 25 years or going to mars in 40 years i get almost pissed off , " he said . " what are you going to do in all this time ?
my way of thinking , technology needs to get started and to do things in a way that some might call overspeed or high-speed or something .
but i mean , why wait ? "
effects on future funding not yet clear while madsen might be anxious to get going , it 's hard when he and von bengtson are the only full-time employees of the project .
plus , all the funding has come from corporations and members of the public , who donate handfuls of euros and danish kroner at a time .
it 's still too soon to tell if the failed launch will adversely affect future donations , even if danish media have been poking fun at the failure .
as a joke , one danish television show even presented the organizers with a new hairdryer to replace the one that was left unplugged .
von bengtson explains that copenhagen suborbitals are deliberately targeting smaller donations so that they wo n't be subject to a large company pulling out .
but although they had been optimistic , bengtson says they may have been expecting too much the first time around .
" you have to know , and you have to accept that the chances of getting your first developed rocket in the air is rather slim " , says bengtson , noting also that even nasa has had lots of failures along the way .
next launch planned for 2011 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while this year 's sea launch failed , organizers remain undeterred von bengtson also said that the team has rescheduled this test launch for june 2011 .
they have to wait that long to get permission from the danish military to close the airspace again .
presuming that launch is successful , the team has already drafted plans for an even more ambitious rocket the following year .
regardless of the organization 's recent obstacles , peter madsen says that the pair wo n't rest until they actually can launch themselves into space .
" imagine for a moment - just in your mind , that there is a moment in history when you 're looking out through the front of the spacecraft , and you realize that hey , we just put this together , " he said . " i built this with my hands , and my brains and my friends and now i 'm in space in my own thing and i 'm here and we survived it .
the idea of realizing in space that you did it , that would be a great satisfaction . "

it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .
" we look forward to finding a solution to bring additional imagery to people in czech republic . " author : cyrus farivar -lrb- reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

" the dayar mongol may have made much noise two years ago .

mongols are actually well known for their hospitality .

is the soviet union to blame ?
experts say that the mongolian xenophobic attitude towards china can be traced back to the country ’ s past under the thumb of the soviet regime .
moscow ’ s leaders regularly used the threat of china to ensure the mongols ' allegiance .
when the soviet union crumbled and mongolia began its transition to a market economy , the country ’ s traditionally nomadic life fell apart - leaving poor social services and education and growing social disparities .
it remains to be seen whether mongolian authorities can tackle the country ’ s social problems to dry up whatever support there might be for mongolian far right groups .

home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .

the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 environment minister disclaims responsibility for nuclear plant deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says he had no hand in the nuclear extension deal the german environment minister on wednesday said he and his department played no part in the government 's recent decision to extend the running times of nuclear power plants in germany . environment minister norbert roettgen on wednesday said he had not been involved in the deal to extend the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

late on tuesday liao was allowed to board a plane in beijing and has since landed in berlin .
“ i ca n't believe this is all happening ... my thoughts are so varied that i ca n't express myself clearly right now , " a clearly excited liao told reporters before getting on the plane . chinese authorities had previously stopped the author from leaving the country 14 times .
although liao insists he is not a political activist , all of his books are banned by the communist government of china , which views his work as subversive .
the last time the 56-year-old writer tried to leave china , in march 2010 , he was on his way to attend a literary festival in cologne , germany .
however , officials stopped him at the airport and placed him under house arrest in his hometown of chengdu , sichuan .
in 1989 he incurred the wrath of the chinese authorities when he penned an epic poem called " massacre " which criticized his government 's brutal crackdown on freedom protestors at tiananmen square in june of that year .
as a result he was jailed for four years .
on his release from prison , liao earned a living as a musician and doing odd jobs .
he also spent time interviewing people on the fringes of chinese society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao yiwu was invited to one of germany 's foremost literary festivals earlier this year honored guest his first book to be published in the united states was called corpse walker , real life stories : china from the bottom up .
this was the beginning of a number of volumes dealing with people living at the bottom of the chinese food chain .
he has also published china 's unjust court cases and the last of china 's landlords the german government has had repeated high-level contacts with china in a bid to gain permission for liao to travel abroad .
now , it seems that persistence has finally paid off .
he is due to be an honored guest at berlin 's international literary festival and the harbor front literature festival in hamburg .
in berlin , liao was met by the director of the berlin literary festival , ulrich schreiber who told reporters , " we are very happy that we have been successful in inviting liao yiwu to germany and that the chinese government agreed to his visit . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .

the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 15.09.2010 canada 's logging deal fails to appease all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement has been proclaimed good for both loggers and green groups earlier this year canadian loggers and environmentalists signed a landmark agreement hailed as a model of sustainable forestry management .
but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

wednesday 's debate in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , was a chance for opposition politicians to air their grievances over the actions of the government over the past 12 months .
chairman of the main opposition party , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , sigmar gabriel launched an attack on merkel , calling her " the chancellor of the corporations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel led a volley of attacks on merkel 's record spd on the attack gabriel said germany was now in the pockets of big business and that anyone without lobbyists to represent them was " being left behind . "
he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .
he called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax as he argued the markets " have not paid one cent to settle the debts of the financial crisis . "
nuclear opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition has vowed to do all it can to block the lifespan extension of nuclear power plants the critique of merkel 's government was joined by other opposition parties in the parliament .
parliamentary leader of the left party faction , gregor gysi , attacked merkel , saying : " she is the chancellor of the bank lobbyists , the pharmaceutical lobbyists , the private health insurance companies , and now the nuclear lobbyists . "
the government 's recently announced plans for extending the lifespan of nuclear power plants are likely to be one of the more controversial elements of the budget debates .
the opposition spd and the greens have vowed to use all their power to try and block the plans to extend nuclear power plants in germany by between eight and 14 years .
' reasons for confidence ' in response , angela merkel said that her government had secured the financial security of the country and that because of the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- coalition , there were " reasons for confidence . "
" today there is an engine of growth in germany , " she said .
in response to the attacks on her record , the chancellor pointed to the drop in unemployment since she took over power .
" five years ago , unemployment stood at nearly five million .
today it is perhaps just under three million . "
merkel was supported by birgit homburger , the parliamentary leader of the fdp coalition partner .
homburger said the draft budget for 2011 was " socially balanced . "
the total federal expenditure for 2011 is estimated at 307.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 400 billion -rrb- and the level of the deficit at 57.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 74.7 billion -rrb- .
the budget talks are due to last four days .

he labeled the draft budget for 2011 unjust , saying that it did not deal with the issue of seeking redress in the financial sector for the crisis of two years ago .
" some are living the high life and gamble the whole world away , while others work hard , get less and less and will now pay the price , " gabriel said in his address to parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 15.09.2010 eu and france remain at loggerheads over roma deportations , paving way for explosive eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso tried to balance rebuke with reconciliation european commission president jose manuel barroso lent his ' personal backing ' to the bloc ’ s justice commissioner on wednesday , after she slammed french deportations of roma . jose manuel barroso on wednesday sought to defuse a row between the eu and france over president nicolas sarkozy 's policy of deporting travelling roma citizens , sometimes referred to as gypsies .
the european commission president came out in support of justice commissioner viviane reding 's overall sentiments about the french actions , but said that she had gone too far in appearing to make comparisons with hitler 's germany .
in an emotional speech , reding said she was " appalled " by the french measures , and suggested they " gave rise to a situation -lrb- she -rrb- thought europe would not have to witness again after the second world war . "
" one or other of the expressions used in the heat of the moment may have given rise to misunderstanding , " barroso told reporters at a wednesday news conference .
" -lrb- justice commissioner -rrb- reding did not want to establish any parallels between what happened in the second world war and the present . "
barroso , who was to meet with president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday evening ahead of an eu summit on thursday , also insisted that he supported reding 's criticism of the french policy , saying she had his " personal backing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many french citizens think the policy is undemocratic " prohibition of discrimination based on ethnic origin is one of the eu 's fundamental values , and the eu will do whatever is necessary to ensure respect for these principles , " barroso said , indicating that there would be an investigation into the french policy .
sarkozy hits back at a meeting with french lawmakers on wednesday , president sarkozy reportedly promised to address the issue at thursday 's eu summit , and mockingly suggested that viviane reding 's home country of luxembourg could house the roma citizens instead .
" he said that he was just implementing european regulations and french laws .
he said that france 's actions were beyond reproach in this matter , but that if the people of luxembourg want to take them , that would n't be a problem either , " a senator for sarkozy 's center-right ump party , bruno sido , said .
" he said that our policy is right and , as he will explain tomorrow , it 's scandalous that europe expresses itself like this on what france is doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roma are given 300 euros for leaving without making a fuss the government in luxembourg has also weighed in , saying that the justice commissioner was speaking on behalf of the eu , not her home country , when she made the comments .
foreign minister jean asselborn suggested sarkozy was making the false connection with luxembourg intentionally .
" i know that nicolas sarkozy already has issues with the people of luxembourg , but he 's gone too far here , " asselborn said in an apparent reference to a long-running debate over banking secrecy between the two neighbors .
" but for what it 's worth , personally , i happen to side entirely with the stance presented by the european commission , " the foreign minister concluded .
more than 1,000 roma have been expelled since august , when president sarkozy called for the dismantling of unauthorized roma camps .
french ministers say most accepted voluntary repatriation , which includes 300 euros -lrb- $ 390 -rrb- in compensation towards starting a new life ; judges expel the remainder for failing to meet the residence criteria set by the eu .
sarkozy 's government had said it was treating every deportation on a case-by-case basis , but the french position was undermined last week by leaked interior ministry documents suggesting that police had been ordered to make clearing roma camps " a priority . "

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .

" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "

he said western germany should appreciate the achievements of the east . german president , christian wulff , who has spent the last two days visiting the german state of thuringia , has criticized an ongoing and perhaps growing mental division between the former east and west germany .
" it 's obvious that not everyone in the " old states " has understood that one really has to respect what has been achieved here -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- in the last 20 years , " wulff told the thueringer zeitung newspaper .
after the euphoria of german reunification 20 years ago had calmed down , simple prejudices began to arise as the communist state of the german democratic republic started to be assimilated into the new germany .
people in the former east germany were often mockingly referred to as " ossies " or " easterners . "
wulff took pains on tuesday to emphasize that the people of the former west germany could learn a lot from their fellow countrymen , pointing for example to the high standards in education which have been achieved in thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was sworn in as president in july travel broadens the mind the president also hoped that in the future more people from the west of germany would actually go and visit the eastern states of thuringia , saxony , saxony-anhalt , brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania .
wulff , however , also defended the way in which the reunification has been achieved , emphasizing that the former west germany had not simply " annexed the east . "
" the economy of the gdr -lrb- the former east germany -rrb- was in the gutter , " he said , " it was not viable , " although he admitted that it was understandable that this opinion was perhaps not shared by everyone in the former east .
also , president wulff found it upsetting that the anniversary of german reunification on october 3 was often seen negatively .
" why do problems always promote more attention than success ? " he asked rhetorically , " we should also emphasise the positive things , the countless things the german people have in common . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.09.2010 german nuclear plants wo n't sustain conventional weapon attack , greenpeace says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the walls of biblis are too thin , says greenpeace a new greenpeace study claims some of the country 's 17 reactors are n't safe enough to withstand a terrorist attack using russian-built anti-tank missiles . greenpeace specifically examined the outer shells of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants and found those of eight older reactors to be highly vulnerable to an attack .
the walls of containment buildings at , for example , the unterweser , kruemmel and neckarwestheim nuclear power plants were about one meter thick , said oda becker , a physicist at hanover university and author of the study .
that was too thin to protect even against a hit with " a conventional anti-tank missile using modern thermobaric warheads . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-tank weapons are easy to handle and launch by terrorists the russian-built at-14 was one of the most frequently used weapons of this kind , she said and added " just one of these missiles is n't enough , but fewer than ten shots could trigger a horrible scenario . "
massive radiation damage in a likely scenario drawn up by becker , a warhead penetrating the outer shell would cause a massive explosion , destroying most of the plant 's interior , including vital utility and security systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nuclear accident would be worse than chernobyl , says greenpeace this would be followed by " a meltdown of the reactor 's core " and the release of radiation in an " open-containment situation , " meaning that radioactivity is released into the environment .
" within just a few hours , radiation will create a 25-kilometer zone of death around the plant , " she said , adding that one third of germany " would have to be evacuated . "
russian results becker based her study on tests made in russia recently , which suggest that reactor containment buildings need to have walls at least 3 meters thick to sustain a hit with an at-14 missile .
russia had carried out the tests because it was much more threatened by terrorism , becker said , and because it was aware of the potential damage its at-14 weapon system could cause .
after all , russia had exported at-14s in large numbers , including to countries suspected of harboring terrorists " like yemen , syria and algeria . "
' shut them down immediately ' greenpeace dismissed allegations of scaremongering in connection with its study .
" but the german government must take our findings seriously , and immediately shut down the older , most vulnerable nuclear power plants , " said heinz smital , a nuclear expert with greenpeace germany .
smital also criticized the government 's recent decision to prolong the lifetimes of german reactors by an average of 12 years , saying the move would create an " incalculable security risk " for the german population .
in an accord with germany 's nuclear operators , berlin decided against insisting that reactors be upgraded to protect against a terrorist attack with an airplane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's pro-nuclear policy is under fire the government apparently considers the risk of such an attack to be limited and the costs too high , at around a billion euros per plant .
greenpeace says it intends to use its report as the basis for bringing a legal case against the government , and argues that berlin is grossly neglecting its duty to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy and secure life .

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 15.09.2010 czech republic stops google from further street view photography großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google 's street view is used daily by millions of europeans czech data protection authorities refused google 's second attempt to resume street view photos , however , photos that are already online will remain .
inquiries into the google project continue in other eu states . czech data protection authorities said tuesday that they have rejected google 's second application to collect personal data through its street view service .
this move halts any new efforts by google to create new images in the czech republic . however , street view photographs taken prior to the october 2009 czech launch of google street view will remain online . the online service provides detailed street-level photographs of people and buildings .
it has come under fire for both privacy concerns arising from the photographs themselves and the fact that the company had mistakenly collected data from some open wireless networks while taking photographs for street view . google representatives said they disagreed with the opinion of the czech office for personal data protection , which is also known by its czech acronym , uoou . " we 're disappointed with these comments as we believe street view is legal in czech republic , " lena wagner , a google spokesperson , wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" we have in place robust procedures to protect privacy , such as face and number plate blurring and a removals tool .
we 'll continue to engage in dialogue with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- to answer any other questions they have . " according to the reuters news agency , hana stepankova , a uoou spokeswoman , also said talks over the use of google 's data collection in the czech republic would continue . " we do not have complete certainty the information is being processed according to law , " stepankova told reuters . other countries still have questions about google bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google said it will begin its street view service in germany by 2011 the move comes at a time when google has been under fire around the world over its street view service .
a google representative has been summoned to appear before a spanish judge in madrid early next month .
there is also a pending lawsuit in the united states over potential privacy violations . google and german authorities agreed that street view could launch in germany before the end of the year .
the company has allowed germans to have themselves and their homes removed from street view prior to publication by submitting their names and addresses to the company . german chancellor angela merkel said last month that she would allow her residence to be photographed .
several of her ministers said they would exclude their homes from the service . varying privacy demands privacy experts said google 's expansion , especially across europe , has been a wake-up call for the california-based company . " even though the european union has passed a data protection directive harmonizing data protection at a high level throughout the union , the directive permits some national flexibility in implementation and interpretation , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore , in an e-mail to deutsche welle . " it is conceivable that capturing license plates and building facades through street view is legal in the uk , but illegal in the czech republic .
especially nations with a surveillance past -lrb- like eastern and central europe -rrb- often have tough privacy laws .
it will take a long time and much effort for google to navigate this thicket of information privacy laws . " meanwhile , the company is continuing to expand the service in europe and said last month that it was sending street view cars to latvia . google 's wagner said google remains optimistic about changing the uoou 's opinion . " street view has proved a popular and useful tool for consumers and businesses around the world , " she wrote .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 15.09.2010 doctors protest lower pay in health care reform package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of many protesting german doctors thousands of general practitioners shut their offices in protest to plans to reform the german health care system .
they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

they warn of declining care and fewer doctors , but the government says it must save money . thousands of doctors gathered across germany on wednesday to protest a section of the government 's proposed health care reform that would lead to less pay for them .
around 1,000 doctors , together with employees and patients , held a demonstration in the city of essen , according to union organizers , while around 3,000 were expected at a parallel demonstration in the southwestern town of sindelfingen .
in addition , one in four doctors ' practices stayed shut throughout the day , organizers said .
the action comes a week before the german cabinet is to discuss a reform package proposed by health minister philipp roesler .
the reform includes increased fees for patients and savings from insurers , hospitals and doctors , meant to fill the system 's 11 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- funding gap the government foresees for 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher fees are meant to ensure quality care rising fees under the current contract negotiated between public insurance companies and unions , general practitioners are paid an extra fee for acting as a sort of gatekeeper for their patients - treating them when they are able and referring them to specialists when necessary .
the agreement was meant to provide better recognition of higher quality care .
and indeed this agreement has contributed to an overall increase in fees paid to german doctors .
between 2007 and 2009 , fees rose by 11 percent , according to a report by munich-based daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
the increase was even greater in certain areas , for example 24.1 percent in hamburg .
exodus from germany but the german association of general practitioners claims its members are still paid far less in comparison with specialists , a fact which is leading to an annual exodus of up to 4,000 doctors and medical students to countries where they find better pay .
“ the politicians will wake up when the general practitioner on site is gone , ” dirk mecking , chief of the rhineland branch of the association , said at the protest in essen .
“ this is war against the doctors . ”
berthold dietsche , chair of the association 's branch in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , said the elimination of extra compensation for general practitioners would “ stifle an innovative model for out-patient care with minimal bureaucratic costs and equitable compensation . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general practitioners say they already earn too little published salaries on the same day as the protest , the central association of statutory health insurers published current data on doctor compensation .
the approximately 150,000 doctors and psychotherapists in germany are to receive an average of 164,000 euros per year in fees from public insurance agencies , a 22,000 euro increase since 2007 .
however , general practitioners indeed earned less than that figure - an average of 116,000 euros in 2007 - while orthopedic surgeons earned 186,000 euros and radiologists earned 264,000 euros in the same year .
nevertheless , thomas ballast , head of the association of health insurance companies , said the protesting doctors were harming their own reputations .
" general practitioners earned an average gross monthly income of 8,300 euros in 2009 , in addition to private revenue , " he said .
" that 's a salary that will give you a very good life . "

but after decades of conflict a quick fix is highly unlikely . after a marathon five hour meeting at prime minister manmohan singh ’ s residence , attended by the top leaders of various parties , including congress chief sonia gandhi and bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- leaders l.k. advani and nitin gadkari , it was decided that an all-party delegation will visit the troubled kashmir valley to " meet all sections of people and gather all shades of opinions " .
home minister p. chidambaram will organise the visit of the delegation to gain a first-hand impression of the state before deciding on any major measure to restore normalcy .
nearly 90 civilians , mostly teenagers , have been killed in the last three months in kashmir and clashes between stone-pelters and security forces have become a near-daily happening on kashmir ’ s streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussion with citizens is imperative no decision on armed forces act there was no consensus on the withdrawal of the controversial armed forces special powers act or afspa in the state as the bjp , the security establishment and even a section of ministers in the ruling government remained firmly opposed to its dilution .
the afspa gives army officers legal immunity for their actions and it can conduct searches and arrests without warrants .
opposition leader of the state and peoples democratic party chief mehbooba mufti , who was vocal in the meeting , said that mere words were not enough to assuage feelings : " a phased withdrawal of the security forces from the civilian areas and the afspa must be revoked .
but today again there was a discussion and it is now up to the central government to take a decision .
but we would definitely want to have something very real and concrete and not something cosmetic . "
people 's opinion is imperative many had expected the government to come out with a clear-cut strategy to deal with the deteriorating law and order situation and extend a healing touch to inflamed passions in the valley .
noted kashmiri author and political commentator basharat peer says the government ’ s priority is to talk to the protesters .
" i don ’ t think there is too much of an investigation needed in terms of the shades of opinion in kashmir , they are pretty well known .
and i think at this point the crucial thing for the government is to really start talks with people who are challenging india ’ s authority on kashmir .
that ’ s where the negotiations should be .. with people who are saying no to india and then see how far each side can move . "
in his opening remarks prime minister singh had expressed his distress at " young men and women - even children " protesting on the streets of kashmir and stressed that the route to lasting peace in the valley was through dialogue and discussion .
congress chief sonia gandhi also appealed to all political parties to take a " suitable decision " to break the " vicious cycle of violence and suffering " in the state .
leaders to travel to kashmir mufti said an unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders was the way out .
" the pm must offer an unconditional dialogue .
not only from his side , but i would also expect it from the other side .. that the hurriyat , the separatists they should not put forward any conditions and there has to be a dialogue .
but before that we need to release the prisoners and we need to lift the siege . "
all eyes will now be on the visit of the all-party delegation that meets various sections of kashmir ’ s society .
as to whether it can assuage tempers in the valley and bring a halt to the violence that has taken a heavy toll will be keenly watched .

but a fresh lawsuit suggests not everyone is happy with the deal that was cut . it 's not everyday you see greenpeace making nice with forest companies . but a deal , signed earlier this year in canada , will result in less logging in the country 's vast northern forests . it 's being trumpeted as an end to the polarized fighting between loggers and environmentalists , despite signs that it may already be splitting forest campaigners . the may 2010 boreal forest agreement between nine environmental groups and 21 major forest companies covers more than 72 million hectares -lrb- 278,125 square miles -rrb- of public forests from canada 's east to west coasts and is equivalent to an area twice the size of germany . this week , the two heads , avrim lazar , president of forest product association of canada and richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada , described the deal as a " revolutionary understanding " in a joint op-ed for national geographic magazine . " it 's of global significance because this is the way everyone hoped the world could work . " give and take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree they need trees and forests under the deal , new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of boreal forest has been suspended for three years , and conservation plans for endangered species , including canada 's woodland caribou , have been developed . for their part , environmental groups have suspended " do not buy " campaigns directed against canadian forestry companies . the canadian forestry industry is worth over 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53 billion canadian -rrb- . after years of confrontations with the forestry companies , the nine environmental groups that signed the agreement would achieve the results they wanted , according to richard brooks , the forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace canada . " this is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest over a vast area , " brooks said . " it is our last chance to save vast areas that will be durable to climate change .
it 's our best and last chance to put in forest management practices that we can be proud of here in canada , and around the world . " species still at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speices of caribou are still in danger , first nations members say yet doubts about the agreement 's true value are already beginning to emerge . one of conservationists ' key motivations for the agreement was to secure habitat for woodland caribou , an emblematic species of canada 's boreal forests . yet even with the agreement in place , the caribou 's habitat continues to be threatened , and the species remains at risk . on september 9 , a group of alberta 's first nations people launched a lawsuit against canada 's federal government . the group said the canadian government was n't doing enough to protect woodland caribou and their habitat in the boreal forest . " minister prentice , the federal minister of environment , is required , under the federal species at risk act , to prepare a plan to assist in the recovery of the caribou , and he has n't done that , " said jack woodward , a lawyer representing beaver lake cree nations , enoch , cree nations and athabasca chipewayan first nations . the first nations groups are arguing a large part of the boreal forest in north-eastern alberta is critical habitat for woodland caribou , and must be free of industrial development . the suit draws on research from the university of alberta that has suggested some herds could face extinction if their forest habitat isn ’ t further protected . ellen adelberg , of the canadian parks and wilderness society - one of the environmental organizations that signed onto the boreal forest agreement , said the issue highlights the concern that more needs to be done to protect boreal woodland caribou habitat as they teeter on the brink of extinction . she added that pressure is mounting on industry and governments to protect more boreal woodland caribou habitat , a point proven by the agreement , and the first nations legal petition . author : cesil fernandes -lrb- sms , cf -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .
a 2009 ipsos mori poll found there were some 5.2 million catholics , about 9.6 percent of the population .
according to paul woolley , director of public theology think tank theos , it 's difficult to know how much of that boost can be attributed to immigration .
" but certainly anecdotally it is a significant factor in that growth . "
more catholics , less attendance but immigration is n't the whole story , he told deutsche welle , and the reality is complicated .
a trip to a polish supermarket in west london found that every single shopper described him or herself as catholic , but not one was aware of the pope 's impending visit .
the national secular society claims mass attendance in britain has dropped by half in two decades from nearly 2 million in 1990 to just under a million in 2010 .
while there may be more people in britain who call themselves catholic that does n't necessarily mean there are more practicing catholics .
a more conservative approach those eastern european catholics who are attending mass are changing things , according to woolley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are concerned that polish catholic churches are too separate from the main church " migration is not only increasing catholic numbers , but it 's also shaping theology , " he said .
" it 's making it not only orthodox , but perhaps more conservative than it has been in the past . "
this comes at a time when pope benedict is leading the catholic church to stick to traditional values .
concern has been raised , however , right at the top of the church , about a separate polish catholic church being created in britain and that catholic poles are not integrating fast enough into the wider church .
as immigration from eastern europe slows due to the recession , the catholic church may have to look elsewhere to boost its numbers .

the ranks of catholics in the uk have swelled in recent years with immigrants from eastern europe . at st. andrew bobola 's polish church in shepherd 's bush , west london , the rev. marek reczek has been busy preparing for the pope 's visit and says he is taking a sizeable contingent to a vigil with the pontiff in hyde park on saturday .
" two hundred and fifty people .
polish people , " he tells deutsche welle .
" we want to pray and meet with our father . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parishioners at st. andrew bobola 's are eager to attend a vigil with the pope , their priest says the 2004 accession of poland to the european union saw tens of thousands of poles migrating to the uk - many of them bringing their staunch catholic faith with them .
this has helped the catholic church in england and wales slow a decline in congregation sizes .
in the last uk census in 2001 there were 4.2 million catholics in england and wales - 8 per cent of the population .

" i did not play a part in formulating the contract , and neither did any member of the environment ministry , " roettgen said during a special sitting of the environment ministry committee in parliament , according to government sources .
roettgen had earlier argued for a shorter extension of the running times while chancellor angela merkel 's government hammered out the deal , which has met with widespread criticism .
however , the environment minister also said there had been no need for his ministry to take part in the discussions , because they focused on financial issues arising from the nuclear sector 's profits , rather than safety issues which are his department 's area of responsibility .
when extending the running time of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of roughly 12 years , the government struck a deal with the major atomic energy providers on a new tax on nuclear fuel rods and other voluntary financial contributions designed to help develop the renewable energy sector .
during the debate , roettgen never really offered his support for the plan and frequently said that he would oppose pushing such a contentious policy through by the back door .
german citizens " betrayed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace , and much of germany , opposes the policy germany 's main opposition parties , who introduced the previous plan to shut down all atomic power plants by 2021 and have pledged to reverse the nuclear extension should they regain power , said roettgen 's statements show that the government forged a " secret deal . "
the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , said the safety of german citizens had been " betrayed and sold " by the government .
meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "

meanwhile , the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , thomas oppermann , said that roettgen 's exclusion from the deal showed a " deep discord " between chancellor merkel and her minister for the environment .
according to oppermann , " merkel left roettgen standing outside in the rain , like a schoolboy . "
the government maintains that traditional sources , most notably coal and nuclear power , must serve as a bridge towards a more environmentally-friendly energy policy , pledging to harvest four-fifths of the country 's power from renewable sources by 2050 .
when she announced the new plan , merkel said it would eventually prove itself " the greenest in the world " .
in wednesday 's committee meeting , roettgen was keen to focus on renewable energy , outlining plans for a new special fund to help develop renewable energies and improve energy efficiency - partly funded by new levies on nuclear power providers .
" we are improving safety levels , " the environment minister said , adding that germany would use nuclear power " for as short a time as possible , but for as long as necessary . "
