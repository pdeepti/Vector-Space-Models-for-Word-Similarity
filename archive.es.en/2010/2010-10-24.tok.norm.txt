program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 24.10.2010 anti-muslim groups gain ground in britain and across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edl has clashed with the police at its protests the anti-muslim english defence league has staged more than 10 violent demonstrations across england since forming last year .
now the group is taking its far-right rhetoric to continental europe . it 's a street movement that has grown so rapidly in size some call it the biggest threat to social cohesion in today 's britain .
the english defence league -lrb- edl -rrb- , an anti-muslim group drawing supporters from the far-right , now can expect a thousand supporters to come out in protest nearly anywhere in england - demonstrations which often descend into violence and racist , islamophobic chanting . now they 're taking their far-right rhetoric to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilder 's rhetoric has landed him in court they had been planning to gather in amsterdam on oct .
30 to show support on what was originally to be last day in court for geert wilders , the anti-islam dutch politician charged with inciting hatred and discrimination against muslims .
on oct .
22 , however , a dutch court ordered a retrial with a new panel of judges .
it was n't immediately clear how this would affect the edl 's plans . " we 're not going anywhere .
we 're growing in strength .
we 're growing in number .
we will be here next year ; we will be here for the next 10 years , " said edl spokesman tommy robinson into the microphone at an illegally held demonstration in the english city of leicester earlier this month .
" the police weigh up the situation , and rather than deal with islamic militant muslim gangs , peddling heroin , taking liberties in our towns and cities , taking liberties with our youth , taking liberties with non-muslim youths , non-muslim girls - raping , pimping , beating , abusing our whole system , " he said to cheers and applause .
tommy robinson is not his real name - the real tommy robinson is a convicted football hooligan from luton , the city where edl was founded just last year .
despite such of rhetoric , robinson and other prominent edl members maintain they are a non-racist , non-violent organization and that their only goal is to fight what they see as extreme islamists threatening the democratic fabric of the western world .
they say they welcome members of all colors and backgrounds , and hold up one prominent sikh member as an example of this .
they also vehemently deny charges of being neo-nazis , and often carry israeli flags in their demonstrations .
an alternative weyman bennett is one of many who do not accept the edl 's own version of themselves .
he is the leader of the pressure group unite against fascism .
" the english defence league are a mish-mash of football hooligans , nazis , malcontents , some people with a clear political ideology about which way they want to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" and people are saying there is a crisis in europe and that muslims are to blame , in the same way as they blamed jewish people . "
bennett says the edl has attacked his group 's meetings , beating people up , and have put pig heads outside mosques to insult muslims .
anti-fascists look to join forces too if far-right street movements are finding common ground across the eu , some warn it 's time for anti-fascist groups and mainstream politicians to react .
" i think not since the 30s have we seen waves of these levels of bigotry and we have to do something to fight it , " bennett said .
glyn ford , a former member of the european parliament from britain 's labour party , agrees .
he 's the national treasurer of the anti-nazi league and the author of the book fascist europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-fascist groups say they need to band together " clearly this is not a british problem , it 's not a dutch problem , a german problem - it 's a problem for western-style democracies all across the european union , " he said .
" the fact that extreme right-wingers and neo-fascists are starting to get together really for me is a message that all the anti-fascist organisations all across europe also need to work together , " he added . " it 's not a surprise to me that they find , if you want , fellow feeling with the likes of geert wilders or jean-marie le pen 's front national or the freedom party in austria or the republikaner in germany or whatever . "
hordes of mainly young men brandishing the cross of st george and chanting anti-muslim and racist messages have become an embarrassment for the uk government , which earlier this month banned a planned edl march in leicester .
former london mayor ken livingstone says politicians need to address the underlying causes of the rise of organisations like the edl .
" fascists , wherever they are , feed off poverty , homelessness , all those things , and you got to have a much better and fairer welfare state if you 're to tackle them , " he said .
" but also i believe that a lot of politicians who ignore them , do n't give them publicity , have to take them on and say , you know , this is the ideology that led to the greatest loss of life in human history - some 35 million people died in world war ii because a small group of mad nazis felt there were racial differences that made some people sub-human . "
wins for the right across europe livingstone worries that europe as a whole has taken a wrong turn too far to the right .
" you see even in sweden there 's a far-right party voted into parliament , " he said .
" all over europe : a unanimous vote in the french assembly to ban the hijab , the swiss banning minarets .
i 'm afraid all that great 1950s , 60s and 70s confidence of europe as it rebuilt its industry , created the welfare state - it seems europe 's turning in on itself .
and i do n't want to be part of that . "
the dutch anti-islam politician , geert wilders , has become the face of the political far-right in europe .
earlier this month , however , wilders sought to distance himself from the english defence league and other groups wanting to show him support in amsterdam .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .

mediation is taking place between the sides to work out a solution . both opponents and supporters of the controversial stuttgart 21 railway project gathered on saturday to make their message heard following a first round of mediation talks over the controversial railway project .
police said some 16,000 opponents were present although opposition organizers put the number at 50,000 .
authorities counted around 7,000 supporters of the railway plan , although there were no major incidents at the demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , people in favor of the project have been taking to the streets those against the stuttgart 21 rail project called for a complete stop to construction , demanding the resignation of baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus and denouncing authorities as " liars . "
they claimed the government has not been transparent on the issue .
at the same time , supporters of the project gathered in the palace gardens near to the station to chant " keep on building . "
rail chief vows to press on supporters welcomed remarks by ruediger grube - the chairman of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn - in favor of the demolition of stuttgart 's old train station .
the station is to be replaced with a new underground facility - with construction costs estimated to reach 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion dollars . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn chief grube 's comments were welcomed , at least by some " deutsche bahn can not , may not and will not stop , " grube told the supporters , adding that the project was good for the city and that 1.4 billion euros in contract payments would have to be paid if the contract was abandoned . the project has been the subject of protracted and sometimes violent protests , culminating with police water cannons being used against protesters on september 29 .
the police actions later drew widespread criticism and a mediation process was launched .
environmental and financial costs opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters , who have taken to the streets in increasing numbers in recent weeks , say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although some 290 palace garden trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were used against protesters , prompting criticism of police opposing parties began a first round of negotiations on friday .
mediation talks are to continue every friday until december 3 .
chief mediator heiner geissler said that he believed it would be possible to find a solution to the problem .
premier mappus has said no further demolition work or tree-clearing is to take place until the next state election , scheduled for march 2011 .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

schaeuble , credited with giving the government an image of authority , says he wo n't stop just yet . a period of uncertainty concerning germany 's economic policy leadership ended sunday when german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble returned to work after a three-week hospitalization .
" schaeuble is back , " ran the front-page headline of the popular tabloid newspaper bild am sonntag , underlining the significance of his return .
schaeuble , who is wheelchair bound and was suffering from severe bedsores , worked from his hospital room during his recuperation .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

mediation is taking place between the sides to work out a solution . both opponents and supporters of the controversial stuttgart 21 railway project gathered on saturday to make their message heard following a first round of mediation talks over the controversial railway project .
police said some 16,000 opponents were present although opposition organizers put the number at 50,000 .
authorities counted around 7,000 supporters of the railway plan , although there were no major incidents at the demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , people in favor of the project have been taking to the streets those against the stuttgart 21 rail project called for a complete stop to construction , demanding the resignation of baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus and denouncing authorities as " liars . "
they claimed the government has not been transparent on the issue .
at the same time , supporters of the project gathered in the palace gardens near to the station to chant " keep on building . "
rail chief vows to press on supporters welcomed remarks by ruediger grube - the chairman of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn - in favor of the demolition of stuttgart 's old train station .
the station is to be replaced with a new underground facility - with construction costs estimated to reach 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion dollars . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn chief grube 's comments were welcomed , at least by some " deutsche bahn can not , may not and will not stop , " grube told the supporters , adding that the project was good for the city and that 1.4 billion euros in contract payments would have to be paid if the contract was abandoned . the project has been the subject of protracted and sometimes violent protests , culminating with police water cannons being used against protesters on september 29 .
the police actions later drew widespread criticism and a mediation process was launched .
environmental and financial costs opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters , who have taken to the streets in increasing numbers in recent weeks , say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although some 290 palace garden trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were used against protesters , prompting criticism of police opposing parties began a first round of negotiations on friday .
mediation talks are to continue every friday until december 3 .
chief mediator heiner geissler said that he believed it would be possible to find a solution to the problem .
premier mappus has said no further demolition work or tree-clearing is to take place until the next state election , scheduled for march 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 24.10.2010 anti-muslim groups gain ground in britain and across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edl has clashed with the police at its protests the anti-muslim english defence league has staged more than 10 violent demonstrations across england since forming last year .
now the group is taking its far-right rhetoric to continental europe . it 's a street movement that has grown so rapidly in size some call it the biggest threat to social cohesion in today 's britain .
the english defence league -lrb- edl -rrb- , an anti-muslim group drawing supporters from the far-right , now can expect a thousand supporters to come out in protest nearly anywhere in england - demonstrations which often descend into violence and racist , islamophobic chanting . now they 're taking their far-right rhetoric to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilder 's rhetoric has landed him in court they had been planning to gather in amsterdam on oct .
30 to show support on what was originally to be last day in court for geert wilders , the anti-islam dutch politician charged with inciting hatred and discrimination against muslims .
on oct .
22 , however , a dutch court ordered a retrial with a new panel of judges .
it was n't immediately clear how this would affect the edl 's plans . " we 're not going anywhere .
we 're growing in strength .
we 're growing in number .
we will be here next year ; we will be here for the next 10 years , " said edl spokesman tommy robinson into the microphone at an illegally held demonstration in the english city of leicester earlier this month .
" the police weigh up the situation , and rather than deal with islamic militant muslim gangs , peddling heroin , taking liberties in our towns and cities , taking liberties with our youth , taking liberties with non-muslim youths , non-muslim girls - raping , pimping , beating , abusing our whole system , " he said to cheers and applause .
tommy robinson is not his real name - the real tommy robinson is a convicted football hooligan from luton , the city where edl was founded just last year .
despite such of rhetoric , robinson and other prominent edl members maintain they are a non-racist , non-violent organization and that their only goal is to fight what they see as extreme islamists threatening the democratic fabric of the western world .
they say they welcome members of all colors and backgrounds , and hold up one prominent sikh member as an example of this .
they also vehemently deny charges of being neo-nazis , and often carry israeli flags in their demonstrations .
an alternative weyman bennett is one of many who do not accept the edl 's own version of themselves .
he is the leader of the pressure group unite against fascism .
" the english defence league are a mish-mash of football hooligans , nazis , malcontents , some people with a clear political ideology about which way they want to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" and people are saying there is a crisis in europe and that muslims are to blame , in the same way as they blamed jewish people . "
bennett says the edl has attacked his group 's meetings , beating people up , and have put pig heads outside mosques to insult muslims .
anti-fascists look to join forces too if far-right street movements are finding common ground across the eu , some warn it 's time for anti-fascist groups and mainstream politicians to react .
" i think not since the 30s have we seen waves of these levels of bigotry and we have to do something to fight it , " bennett said .
glyn ford , a former member of the european parliament from britain 's labour party , agrees .
he 's the national treasurer of the anti-nazi league and the author of the book fascist europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-fascist groups say they need to band together " clearly this is not a british problem , it 's not a dutch problem , a german problem - it 's a problem for western-style democracies all across the european union , " he said .
" the fact that extreme right-wingers and neo-fascists are starting to get together really for me is a message that all the anti-fascist organisations all across europe also need to work together , " he added . " it 's not a surprise to me that they find , if you want , fellow feeling with the likes of geert wilders or jean-marie le pen 's front national or the freedom party in austria or the republikaner in germany or whatever . "
hordes of mainly young men brandishing the cross of st george and chanting anti-muslim and racist messages have become an embarrassment for the uk government , which earlier this month banned a planned edl march in leicester .
former london mayor ken livingstone says politicians need to address the underlying causes of the rise of organisations like the edl .
" fascists , wherever they are , feed off poverty , homelessness , all those things , and you got to have a much better and fairer welfare state if you 're to tackle them , " he said .
" but also i believe that a lot of politicians who ignore them , do n't give them publicity , have to take them on and say , you know , this is the ideology that led to the greatest loss of life in human history - some 35 million people died in world war ii because a small group of mad nazis felt there were racial differences that made some people sub-human . "
wins for the right across europe livingstone worries that europe as a whole has taken a wrong turn too far to the right .
" you see even in sweden there 's a far-right party voted into parliament , " he said .
" all over europe : a unanimous vote in the french assembly to ban the hijab , the swiss banning minarets .
i 'm afraid all that great 1950s , 60s and 70s confidence of europe as it rebuilt its industry , created the welfare state - it seems europe 's turning in on itself .
and i do n't want to be part of that . "
the dutch anti-islam politician , geert wilders , has become the face of the political far-right in europe .
earlier this month , however , wilders sought to distance himself from the english defence league and other groups wanting to show him support in amsterdam .

' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

mediation is taking place between the sides to work out a solution . both opponents and supporters of the controversial stuttgart 21 railway project gathered on saturday to make their message heard following a first round of mediation talks over the controversial railway project .
police said some 16,000 opponents were present although opposition organizers put the number at 50,000 .
authorities counted around 7,000 supporters of the railway plan , although there were no major incidents at the demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , people in favor of the project have been taking to the streets those against the stuttgart 21 rail project called for a complete stop to construction , demanding the resignation of baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus and denouncing authorities as " liars . "
they claimed the government has not been transparent on the issue .
at the same time , supporters of the project gathered in the palace gardens near to the station to chant " keep on building . "
rail chief vows to press on supporters welcomed remarks by ruediger grube - the chairman of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn - in favor of the demolition of stuttgart 's old train station .
the station is to be replaced with a new underground facility - with construction costs estimated to reach 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion dollars . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn chief grube 's comments were welcomed , at least by some " deutsche bahn can not , may not and will not stop , " grube told the supporters , adding that the project was good for the city and that 1.4 billion euros in contract payments would have to be paid if the contract was abandoned . the project has been the subject of protracted and sometimes violent protests , culminating with police water cannons being used against protesters on september 29 .
the police actions later drew widespread criticism and a mediation process was launched .
environmental and financial costs opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters , who have taken to the streets in increasing numbers in recent weeks , say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although some 290 palace garden trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were used against protesters , prompting criticism of police opposing parties began a first round of negotiations on friday .
mediation talks are to continue every friday until december 3 .
chief mediator heiner geissler said that he believed it would be possible to find a solution to the problem .
premier mappus has said no further demolition work or tree-clearing is to take place until the next state election , scheduled for march 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

mediation is taking place between the sides to work out a solution . both opponents and supporters of the controversial stuttgart 21 railway project gathered on saturday to make their message heard following a first round of mediation talks over the controversial railway project .
police said some 16,000 opponents were present although opposition organizers put the number at 50,000 .
authorities counted around 7,000 supporters of the railway plan , although there were no major incidents at the demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , people in favor of the project have been taking to the streets those against the stuttgart 21 rail project called for a complete stop to construction , demanding the resignation of baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus and denouncing authorities as " liars . "
they claimed the government has not been transparent on the issue .
at the same time , supporters of the project gathered in the palace gardens near to the station to chant " keep on building . "
rail chief vows to press on supporters welcomed remarks by ruediger grube - the chairman of germany 's national rail operator deutsche bahn - in favor of the demolition of stuttgart 's old train station .
the station is to be replaced with a new underground facility - with construction costs estimated to reach 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion dollars . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn chief grube 's comments were welcomed , at least by some " deutsche bahn can not , may not and will not stop , " grube told the supporters , adding that the project was good for the city and that 1.4 billion euros in contract payments would have to be paid if the contract was abandoned . the project has been the subject of protracted and sometimes violent protests , culminating with police water cannons being used against protesters on september 29 .
the police actions later drew widespread criticism and a mediation process was launched .
environmental and financial costs opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters , who have taken to the streets in increasing numbers in recent weeks , say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although some 290 palace garden trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water cannons were used against protesters , prompting criticism of police opposing parties began a first round of negotiations on friday .
mediation talks are to continue every friday until december 3 .
chief mediator heiner geissler said that he believed it would be possible to find a solution to the problem .
premier mappus has said no further demolition work or tree-clearing is to take place until the next state election , scheduled for march 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 24.10.2010 anti-muslim groups gain ground in britain and across europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edl has clashed with the police at its protests the anti-muslim english defence league has staged more than 10 violent demonstrations across england since forming last year .
now the group is taking its far-right rhetoric to continental europe . it 's a street movement that has grown so rapidly in size some call it the biggest threat to social cohesion in today 's britain .
the english defence league -lrb- edl -rrb- , an anti-muslim group drawing supporters from the far-right , now can expect a thousand supporters to come out in protest nearly anywhere in england - demonstrations which often descend into violence and racist , islamophobic chanting . now they 're taking their far-right rhetoric to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilder 's rhetoric has landed him in court they had been planning to gather in amsterdam on oct .
30 to show support on what was originally to be last day in court for geert wilders , the anti-islam dutch politician charged with inciting hatred and discrimination against muslims .
on oct .
22 , however , a dutch court ordered a retrial with a new panel of judges .
it was n't immediately clear how this would affect the edl 's plans . " we 're not going anywhere .
we 're growing in strength .
we 're growing in number .
we will be here next year ; we will be here for the next 10 years , " said edl spokesman tommy robinson into the microphone at an illegally held demonstration in the english city of leicester earlier this month .
" the police weigh up the situation , and rather than deal with islamic militant muslim gangs , peddling heroin , taking liberties in our towns and cities , taking liberties with our youth , taking liberties with non-muslim youths , non-muslim girls - raping , pimping , beating , abusing our whole system , " he said to cheers and applause .
tommy robinson is not his real name - the real tommy robinson is a convicted football hooligan from luton , the city where edl was founded just last year .
despite such of rhetoric , robinson and other prominent edl members maintain they are a non-racist , non-violent organization and that their only goal is to fight what they see as extreme islamists threatening the democratic fabric of the western world .
they say they welcome members of all colors and backgrounds , and hold up one prominent sikh member as an example of this .
they also vehemently deny charges of being neo-nazis , and often carry israeli flags in their demonstrations .
an alternative weyman bennett is one of many who do not accept the edl 's own version of themselves .
he is the leader of the pressure group unite against fascism .
" the english defence league are a mish-mash of football hooligans , nazis , malcontents , some people with a clear political ideology about which way they want to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" and people are saying there is a crisis in europe and that muslims are to blame , in the same way as they blamed jewish people . "
bennett says the edl has attacked his group 's meetings , beating people up , and have put pig heads outside mosques to insult muslims .
anti-fascists look to join forces too if far-right street movements are finding common ground across the eu , some warn it 's time for anti-fascist groups and mainstream politicians to react .
" i think not since the 30s have we seen waves of these levels of bigotry and we have to do something to fight it , " bennett said .
glyn ford , a former member of the european parliament from britain 's labour party , agrees .
he 's the national treasurer of the anti-nazi league and the author of the book fascist europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-fascist groups say they need to band together " clearly this is not a british problem , it 's not a dutch problem , a german problem - it 's a problem for western-style democracies all across the european union , " he said .
" the fact that extreme right-wingers and neo-fascists are starting to get together really for me is a message that all the anti-fascist organisations all across europe also need to work together , " he added . " it 's not a surprise to me that they find , if you want , fellow feeling with the likes of geert wilders or jean-marie le pen 's front national or the freedom party in austria or the republikaner in germany or whatever . "
hordes of mainly young men brandishing the cross of st george and chanting anti-muslim and racist messages have become an embarrassment for the uk government , which earlier this month banned a planned edl march in leicester .
former london mayor ken livingstone says politicians need to address the underlying causes of the rise of organisations like the edl .
" fascists , wherever they are , feed off poverty , homelessness , all those things , and you got to have a much better and fairer welfare state if you 're to tackle them , " he said .
" but also i believe that a lot of politicians who ignore them , do n't give them publicity , have to take them on and say , you know , this is the ideology that led to the greatest loss of life in human history - some 35 million people died in world war ii because a small group of mad nazis felt there were racial differences that made some people sub-human . "
wins for the right across europe livingstone worries that europe as a whole has taken a wrong turn too far to the right .
" you see even in sweden there 's a far-right party voted into parliament , " he said .
" all over europe : a unanimous vote in the french assembly to ban the hijab , the swiss banning minarets .
i 'm afraid all that great 1950s , 60s and 70s confidence of europe as it rebuilt its industry , created the welfare state - it seems europe 's turning in on itself .
and i do n't want to be part of that . "
the dutch anti-islam politician , geert wilders , has become the face of the political far-right in europe .

mediation is taking place between the sides to work out a solution . both opponents and supporters of the controversial stuttgart 21 railway project gathered on saturday to make their message heard following a first round of mediation talks over the controversial railway project .

the police actions later drew widespread criticism and a mediation process was launched .
environmental and financial costs opponents claim the project to make stuttgart part of a high-speed rail route across europe is too expensive and that its construction will damage the environment .
supporters , who have taken to the streets in increasing numbers in recent weeks , say that the connection will eventually bring more money to stuttgart .
they say that although some 290 palace garden trees will need to be chopped down in the building process , this can be offset with the planting of even more trees when construction is completed .

the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .

mainz has now overcome previously-untouchable dortmund as top team on the bundesliga table . mainz reclaimed the top spot of the bundesliga table sunday , pushing borussia dortmund by two points down to number two , after they beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 with a goal from austrian andreas ivanschitz .
mainz , which now has 24 points , secured its victory when ivanschitz scored the game 's only goal on the 70th minute .
dortmund draws , drops to second bundesliga leaders borussia dortmund , meanwhile , managed to pull off a last-gasp , 1-1 draw with hoffenheim sunday in dortmund , but it was not enough to save them their top spot on the table .
the team scored their only point when antonio da silva grabbed a goal in stoppage time after the team failed to convert a penalty earlier in the game .
borussia , gunning for their eighth win in a row , looked to be heading for their first loss since august when demba ba fired the visitors ahead in the first half .
hoffenheim goalkeeper tom starke also saved nuri sahin 's penalty six minutes later .
finally , da silva delivered a curling free kick bringing the game to level three minutes into added time .
da silva 's score sent hoffenheim midfielder vedad salihovic into a rage , and he was kicked off the pitch after the final whistle for protesting .
bildunterschrift : da silva delivered the equalizing kick in added time " the way we played in the second half was unbelievable .
i am super proud , " said dortmund coach juergen klopp .
in sunday 's other bundesliga match , stuttgart shut out st. pauli 2-0 to creep up from last place .
cologne fires coach also sunday , cologne 's soccer team fired croatian coach zvonimir soldo after they lost 2-1 at hanover 96 on saturday , leaving them at the very bottom of the bundesliga .
" cologne and zvonimir soldo ended their collaboration on sunday , " the club said in a brief statement as they appointed under-23 boss frank schaefer as caretaker coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .

" the german government has made a large contribution to the strengthening of the stability pact , one that exceeded all expectations , " he told the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
as schaeuble 's comments were published , eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday for preliminary discussions on the reform , which would require amending the 11-month old lisbon treaty .
pact needs better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said the compromise was the best germany could hope for in the wake of major debt crises in greece and other eurozone countries , eu states have sought to toughen the rules of the so-called " stability and growth pact , " which , among other things , requires eurozone states to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the pact was criticized for having no proper enforcement mechanisms .
germany had sought to impose tough , automatic sanctions on countries which exceed deficit limits , but france wanted more flexible rules .
a compromise between chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy would impose semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
' stability sledgehammer ' to ' harmless cotton swab ' after news of the compromise surfaced , politicians from within merkel 's own government parties denounced the compromise as a sell-out .
christian lindner , secretary general of merkel 's junior coalition partners the free democrats , told the daily saarbruecker zeitung on saturday that the revised rules could be " too weak to guarantee a strong euro . "
and kurt lauk , president of the economic council of merkel 's christian democratic union , told german news agency dpa on sunday that the compromise threatened to " turn the promised sledgehammer of stability into a harmless cotton swab . "
but schaeuble said germany " never had a chance at getting automatic sanctions for deficit rulebreakers , " and that the compromise between the eu 's 27 member states was " more than many thought was achievable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 24.10.2010 germany 's foreign ministry was complicit in holocaust , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report holds the ministry complicit in the crimes of the war era germany 's foreign ministry was far more involved in the murder of millions of jews than previously thought , according to a government study .
the findings contradict claims that the ministry disapproved of the nazis . a report to be published this week reveals that diplomats actively assisted the nazis in their campaign of genocide against the jews , contradicting post-war attempts to portray germany 's wartime foreign ministry in a positive light .
" the foreign ministry actively supported all measures of persecution , rights deprivation , expulsions and the holocaust , " eckart conze , one of four historians asked to investigate the role played by the ministry in the holocaust , told the german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" the foreign ministry was actively involved in every operation to persecute , strip away the rights of , expel and exterminate the jews from the very beginning , " conze said .
conze , who spent five years researching diplomatic archives , also condemned the ministry during wartime as a " criminal organization " in the german news magazine spiegel .
conze said post-war claims that officials within the ministry had resisted nazi policies were untrue .
in fact , he said , the ministry had often been proactive in its efforts to carry out the will of the third reich leadership .
the study , commissioned in 2005 by former german foreign minister joschka fischer , looked at the activities of ministry between 1933 and 1945 .
the panel of historians is due to present its full findings later this week .
support of war-crime suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign minister fischer ordered the report fischer was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he was " horrified " by the level of support and advice offered by the ministry to help war-crime suspects escape germany after the country 's defeat .
" as i read this report , i became more and more shocked , " said fischer .
among the documents was a paper from the official responsible for jewish affairs , franz rademacher , citing the " liquidation of jews in belgrade " as a reason for one of his foreign trips .
the report was praised by current foreign minister guido westerwelle as " an important work " that would contribute greatly to the ministry 's knowledge of its own past .
westerwelle 's predecessor , frank-walter steinmeier , said the fact that it had taken 60 years since the end of the war to begin the inquiry was " incredible . "
the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants also hailed the report , saying it " categorically refuted " previous attempts to sanitize the foreign ministry 's role in the holocaust .
" germany has taken an honest and painful look at its past , " said the group 's president elan steinberg in a statement .
" this report is a pointed reminder of the broad cross section of german society and institutions which were implicated in the holocaust and the brutalities of the nazi regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mann was condemned in the ministry for writing literature " hostile " to the nazis campaign against ' hostile ' author it was also revealed that ernst von weizsaecker , who was secretary of state at the ministry from 1938 to 1943 , had pressed for the removal of german citizenship from author thomas mann in 1936 . weizsaecker , father of former german president richard von weizsaecker , was said to be in favor of the action because of mann 's " hostile propaganda " against the third reich . weizsaecker , who after the war was tried for crimes against humanity for alleged complicity in the deportation of french jews to auschwitz , claimed he had always worked against the nazis .
he was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1949 , but died two years later . the ministry 's role has long been controversial because many nazi-era diplomats continued to work for the ministry after 1945 - many claiming they had always been opposed to hitler 's regime .
