the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

dw-world.de karzai plays a risky game with allegations of western interference the rift between afghan president hamid karzai and the west could widen this week over karzai 's recent allegations that foreign powers orchestrated massive fraud in the elections that returned him to power last year .
-lrb- 06.04.2010 -rrb- how effective is international pressure on karzai ?
while there is an emerging consensus to increase troop levels and the funding of the afghan mission , experts are divided over how to deal with president karzai .
some urge support , others want to increase the pressure .
-lrb- 07.12.2009 -rrb- karzai faces run-off after electoral fraud investigation in afghanistan a fraud investigation has ruled that incumbent afghan president hamid karzai failed to reach the necessary 50 percent of the vote in the presidential election , forcing a run-off to be held on november 7 .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .
a spokesman for the free democrats , merkel 's junior coalition partner of which westerwelle is the head , confirmed the report but did not comment any further , adding that the two men " wish to keep this a private affair . "
social union , not marriage in germany , gay marriage is not officially recognized by the state , but since the life partnership act of 2001 the country has granted " registered partnerships " for same-sex couples , which provide some but not all the rights of marriage .
westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .
the outspoken vice chancellor and foreign minister is one of several openly gay politicians in germany , which include berlin mayor klaus wowereit , of the opposition liberal social democrats , and former hamburg mayor ole von beust , of merkel 's christian democrats .
neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

germany is planning to introduce a digital identification card for foreigners in a move to combat illegal immigration .
the id card is only for non-eu citizens living in germany , according to a newspaper report . non-eu citizens living in germany - including turks , americans and swiss - who do not possess a german passport may soon be forced to issue their fingerprints to german authorities , according to a newspaper report published on saturday .
german daily die welt reported that , beginning next year , all foreigners in germany from outside the european union would be required to carry a digital identification card .
the credit-card-sized document is planned to contain the person 's digitized finger prints and photograph and be valid for a maximum of ten years .
' effective means ' to fighting illegal immigration die welt quotes sources from the interior ministry saying the id card will be a " means to combating and preventing illegal immigration " as authorities will be able to " determine the identity of persons without having to refer to any databases . "
another security advantage offered by the electronic residence permit , says security expert hans-peter uhl , will be the ability to determine the " true identity of illegal immigrants caught applying for asylum with falsified documents . "
“ it will give us reliable data on whether immigrants are registered twice , or even three times , and also how many foreigners enter and leave our country , " uhl told die welt .
the digital identification card will be tested this year and is planned to be introduced at some point during 2011 .
at present , an estimated four million non-eu citizens in germany will require the new document .
turks and american account for the highest portion of that number .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

dw-world.de karzai plays a risky game with allegations of western interference the rift between afghan president hamid karzai and the west could widen this week over karzai 's recent allegations that foreign powers orchestrated massive fraud in the elections that returned him to power last year .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .

you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

dw-world.de karzai plays a risky game with allegations of western interference the rift between afghan president hamid karzai and the west could widen this week over karzai 's recent allegations that foreign powers orchestrated massive fraud in the elections that returned him to power last year .
-lrb- 06.04.2010 -rrb- how effective is international pressure on karzai ?
while there is an emerging consensus to increase troop levels and the funding of the afghan mission , experts are divided over how to deal with president karzai .
some urge support , others want to increase the pressure .
-lrb- 07.12.2009 -rrb- karzai faces run-off after electoral fraud investigation in afghanistan a fraud investigation has ruled that incumbent afghan president hamid karzai failed to reach the necessary 50 percent of the vote in the presidential election , forcing a run-off to be held on november 7 .

bayern were held to a goalless draw by cologne and stuttgart kept the goals coming , beating moenchengladbach 7-0 . although mainz coach thomas tuchel claimed he does not look at the league tables much , fans are bound to celebrate the fact that their club has moved to the top of the bundesliga table for the first time ever , after beating bremen 2-0 this saturday .
marcel risse and andre schuerrle scored the goals for mainz , both in the second half , giving the club maximum points on the league table .
" i ca n't remember us ever playing worse than today , " bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted after the match .
bremen manager klaus allofs said the match " was too bad to be true . "
no rhythm for bayern last year 's champions bayern munich did not have much to celebrate at the start of oktoberfest .
they were held to a goalless draw by cologne at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have yet to get into the swing of things " we 're lacking creativity , there 's no rhythm , " said defender phillip lahm after the match .
bayern have had their worst start to the season for 33 years , with only a paltry two goals under their belt so far .
although superior to cologne in terms of ball possession and chances , bayern could not penetrate cologne 's strong defense .
pressure is mounting now to win against hoffenheim on tuesday .
moenchengladbach thrashed stuttgart broke their losing streak in style , with a 7-0 goal-scoring fest against moenchengladbach , which included a hat-trick by russia striker pavel pogrebniak .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart kept those goals coming moenchengladbach , who suffered the worst ever away defeat in the history of the bundesliga , seemed to fall apart completely in the second half .
" we were n't a team today at all , it was a case of none against 11 , " defender tobias levels said after the match .
in saturday 's other matches , wolfsburg collected much-needed points with a 2-0 win against hanover .
an overhead kick by diego put the wolves in the lead in the 55th minute and edin dzeko 's goal 12 minutes later sealed the deal .
hoffenheim drew 2-2 with kaiserslautern and , on friday , freiburg beat frankfurt 1-0 .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .

the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

dw-world.de karzai plays a risky game with allegations of western interference the rift between afghan president hamid karzai and the west could widen this week over karzai 's recent allegations that foreign powers orchestrated massive fraud in the elections that returned him to power last year .
-lrb- 06.04.2010 -rrb- how effective is international pressure on karzai ?
while there is an emerging consensus to increase troop levels and the funding of the afghan mission , experts are divided over how to deal with president karzai .
some urge support , others want to increase the pressure .

for 20 years andre hunger fought to keep it alive .
he has finally given up . andre hunger pours a cup of tea which he says comes from malaysia .
the former personnel manager of mz converted from coffee to tea back in the mid-1990s when an asian investor took over the saxony motorbike company .
it was not a liaison that lasted , and when they pulled out , they took hunger 's hopes for the company 's survival with them .
he says it became apparent that the company was dependent on the decisions of people " somewhere in malaysia , a long way from what was going on and who did n't understand the tradition . "
from the point of their departure , it has downhill all the way . downhill never used to be an issue for the zschopau motorbike manufacturers , whose advertising slogan back in the 1920s was " goes uphill as fast as others go down . " during the gdr era , there were times when annual production exceeded 100,000 and the light , robust , two-stroke engines were commonplace in the eastern bloc and countries in the developing world .
in the 1920s and again in the 1980s the mz motorcycle company , which was founded in 1906 , was the largest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business as usual at the zschopau factory in 1971 in the local museum dedicated to the company , visitors can watch old television reports about the glory days of motorbike sports , in which mz drivers took on honda drivers and the gdr team won the six days trials , the toughest in the world , on mzs .
such prestige made the company a dream workplace for many , including andre hunger , who first joined its ranks in 1988 .
there was never any doubt that that was where the young man who learned about bikes from his grandfather wanted to work new prospects when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the gdr collapsed shortly thereafter , the then 28-year-old mechanical engineer regarded reunification and the market economy as a positive challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre hunger fought hard for survival " we thought everything would get better , without the shortages we had always struggled with .
we thought it was our chance to finally prove what we were made of , " andre hunger said .
like everyone else , he forewent 10 percent of his wages in order to help the company forge ahead , and in 1990 his co-workers elected him to the works council .
but it was n't long before the dream of making a splash in unified germany turned into a nightmare .
sales dropped , and in 1992 mz was forced to file its first petition for bankruptcy .
as a member of the works council , hunger had to rubber stamp a radical redundancy plan that reduced the 3,000-plus workforce to one of just a few hundred .
taking the blame hunger will never forget the trauma of the early 1990s .
he recalls going shopping and bumping into a man who had once worked at the factory .
" his daughter wanted a chocolate father christmas , but the man told her he could n't buy it because he was unemployed , " hunger said .
" and then he pointed at me and said : ' it 's because of that man there that i do n't have a job . '
everyone looked at me and i just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me . " andre hunger says the real guilty party was the treuhand privatization agency set up to oversee the transition from a planned to a market economy .
he believes there were people in the agency connected to west german companies who were keen to crush any competition from east german businesses before they could become a real threat .
" we were told we had to learn how to work properly .
the treuhand absolutely did not want anything to remain in tact , " hunger recalls , adding that the privatization agency was responsible for the death of many traditional companies that could have survived .
enough is enough after two decades of fighting to survive , there is not much left of mz anymore .
the company no longer manufactures bikes , and the factory floor currently accommodates a meager handful of people building electric scooters and bicycles with electric engines .

"
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "
no going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banks were inundated with east germans wanting to exchange their ostmarks monetary union was pushed through without further ado , despite some reservations at the bundesbank .
on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .
but factory closures and high unemployment sparked a political dispute that remains unresolved to this day .
" the treuhand made arbitrary decisions , " said gregor gysi .
" the agency decided which companies received help and which did n't .
they looked for buyers for some firms and ignored others .
i once asked the treuhand president which criteria they used , and she could n't give me an answer . "
theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .
" but it was down to the companies themselves to find the buyers and the international market share to be able to survive . "
many simply went under , and 20 years on , eastern germany is still waiting for the economic upswing which the currency union was designed to trigger .

the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .
but factory closures and high unemployment sparked a political dispute that remains unresolved to this day .
" the treuhand made arbitrary decisions , " said gregor gysi .
" the agency decided which companies received help and which did n't .
they looked for buyers for some firms and ignored others .
i once asked the treuhand president which criteria they used , and she could n't give me an answer . "
theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .
" but it was down to the companies themselves to find the buyers and the international market share to be able to survive . "
many simply went under , and 20 years on , eastern germany is still waiting for the economic upswing which the currency union was designed to trigger .

germany is planning to introduce a digital identification card for foreigners in a move to combat illegal immigration .
the id card is only for non-eu citizens living in germany , according to a newspaper report . non-eu citizens living in germany - including turks , americans and swiss - who do not possess a german passport may soon be forced to issue their fingerprints to german authorities , according to a newspaper report published on saturday .
german daily die welt reported that , beginning next year , all foreigners in germany from outside the european union would be required to carry a digital identification card .
the credit-card-sized document is planned to contain the person 's digitized finger prints and photograph and be valid for a maximum of ten years .
' effective means ' to fighting illegal immigration die welt quotes sources from the interior ministry saying the id card will be a " means to combating and preventing illegal immigration " as authorities will be able to " determine the identity of persons without having to refer to any databases . "
another security advantage offered by the electronic residence permit , says security expert hans-peter uhl , will be the ability to determine the " true identity of illegal immigrants caught applying for asylum with falsified documents . "
“ it will give us reliable data on whether immigrants are registered twice , or even three times , and also how many foreigners enter and leave our country , " uhl told die welt .
the digital identification card will be tested this year and is planned to be introduced at some point during 2011 .
at present , an estimated four million non-eu citizens in germany will require the new document .
turks and american account for the highest portion of that number .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .

huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .

but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .

stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .

" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament .

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .

he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .
a spokesman for the free democrats , merkel 's junior coalition partner of which westerwelle is the head , confirmed the report but did not comment any further , adding that the two men " wish to keep this a private affair . "
social union , not marriage in germany , gay marriage is not officially recognized by the state , but since the life partnership act of 2001 the country has granted " registered partnerships " for same-sex couples , which provide some but not all the rights of marriage .
westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .
the outspoken vice chancellor and foreign minister is one of several openly gay politicians in germany , which include berlin mayor klaus wowereit , of the opposition liberal social democrats , and former hamburg mayor ole von beust , of merkel 's christian democrats .
neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .

westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .

neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "

the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .

but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

germany is planning to introduce a digital identification card for foreigners in a move to combat illegal immigration .
the id card is only for non-eu citizens living in germany , according to a newspaper report . non-eu citizens living in germany - including turks , americans and swiss - who do not possess a german passport may soon be forced to issue their fingerprints to german authorities , according to a newspaper report published on saturday .
german daily die welt reported that , beginning next year , all foreigners in germany from outside the european union would be required to carry a digital identification card .
the credit-card-sized document is planned to contain the person 's digitized finger prints and photograph and be valid for a maximum of ten years .
' effective means ' to fighting illegal immigration die welt quotes sources from the interior ministry saying the id card will be a " means to combating and preventing illegal immigration " as authorities will be able to " determine the identity of persons without having to refer to any databases . "
another security advantage offered by the electronic residence permit , says security expert hans-peter uhl , will be the ability to determine the " true identity of illegal immigrants caught applying for asylum with falsified documents . "
“ it will give us reliable data on whether immigrants are registered twice , or even three times , and also how many foreigners enter and leave our country , " uhl told die welt .
the digital identification card will be tested this year and is planned to be introduced at some point during 2011 .
at present , an estimated four million non-eu citizens in germany will require the new document .
turks and american account for the highest portion of that number .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

for 20 years andre hunger fought to keep it alive .
he has finally given up . andre hunger pours a cup of tea which he says comes from malaysia .
the former personnel manager of mz converted from coffee to tea back in the mid-1990s when an asian investor took over the saxony motorbike company .
it was not a liaison that lasted , and when they pulled out , they took hunger 's hopes for the company 's survival with them .
he says it became apparent that the company was dependent on the decisions of people " somewhere in malaysia , a long way from what was going on and who did n't understand the tradition . "
from the point of their departure , it has downhill all the way . downhill never used to be an issue for the zschopau motorbike manufacturers , whose advertising slogan back in the 1920s was " goes uphill as fast as others go down . " during the gdr era , there were times when annual production exceeded 100,000 and the light , robust , two-stroke engines were commonplace in the eastern bloc and countries in the developing world .
in the 1920s and again in the 1980s the mz motorcycle company , which was founded in 1906 , was the largest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business as usual at the zschopau factory in 1971 in the local museum dedicated to the company , visitors can watch old television reports about the glory days of motorbike sports , in which mz drivers took on honda drivers and the gdr team won the six days trials , the toughest in the world , on mzs .
such prestige made the company a dream workplace for many , including andre hunger , who first joined its ranks in 1988 .
there was never any doubt that that was where the young man who learned about bikes from his grandfather wanted to work new prospects when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the gdr collapsed shortly thereafter , the then 28-year-old mechanical engineer regarded reunification and the market economy as a positive challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre hunger fought hard for survival " we thought everything would get better , without the shortages we had always struggled with .
we thought it was our chance to finally prove what we were made of , " andre hunger said .
like everyone else , he forewent 10 percent of his wages in order to help the company forge ahead , and in 1990 his co-workers elected him to the works council .
but it was n't long before the dream of making a splash in unified germany turned into a nightmare .
sales dropped , and in 1992 mz was forced to file its first petition for bankruptcy .
as a member of the works council , hunger had to rubber stamp a radical redundancy plan that reduced the 3,000-plus workforce to one of just a few hundred .
taking the blame hunger will never forget the trauma of the early 1990s .
he recalls going shopping and bumping into a man who had once worked at the factory .
" his daughter wanted a chocolate father christmas , but the man told her he could n't buy it because he was unemployed , " hunger said .
" and then he pointed at me and said : ' it 's because of that man there that i do n't have a job . '
everyone looked at me and i just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me . " andre hunger says the real guilty party was the treuhand privatization agency set up to oversee the transition from a planned to a market economy .
he believes there were people in the agency connected to west german companies who were keen to crush any competition from east german businesses before they could become a real threat .
" we were told we had to learn how to work properly .
the treuhand absolutely did not want anything to remain in tact , " hunger recalls , adding that the privatization agency was responsible for the death of many traditional companies that could have survived .
enough is enough after two decades of fighting to survive , there is not much left of mz anymore .
the company no longer manufactures bikes , and the factory floor currently accommodates a meager handful of people building electric scooters and bicycles with electric engines .
hunger says the new owners , two former motorbike racing drivers , plan to import chinese models and sell them under the mz trademark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a later mz model but he is not keen on the idea , which does n't sit well with his understanding of a motorcycle factory .
" that 's why i left , " he said .
he is unwilling to say more on the subject for fear that his words could be interpreted locally as betrayal of the old company . the former works council member and long-time head of personnel stopped working at mz in august 2009 , and has now been experiencing interviews from the other side of the desk .
he says he has sent off some 50 applications and is sick of hearing politicians spout their " clever talk " about the lengths to which the unemployed are supposed to go in order to find work . " they have no idea what it means for a person who has led an active life , " hunger said .
" it 's very bitter when you realize they do n't need you any more . "
during the conversation , his telephone rang .
it was a personnel department interested in his application .
but he is not going to let his hopes run away with him .
at least not yet .

the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

germany is planning to introduce a digital identification card for foreigners in a move to combat illegal immigration .
the id card is only for non-eu citizens living in germany , according to a newspaper report . non-eu citizens living in germany - including turks , americans and swiss - who do not possess a german passport may soon be forced to issue their fingerprints to german authorities , according to a newspaper report published on saturday .
german daily die welt reported that , beginning next year , all foreigners in germany from outside the european union would be required to carry a digital identification card .
the credit-card-sized document is planned to contain the person 's digitized finger prints and photograph and be valid for a maximum of ten years .
' effective means ' to fighting illegal immigration die welt quotes sources from the interior ministry saying the id card will be a " means to combating and preventing illegal immigration " as authorities will be able to " determine the identity of persons without having to refer to any databases . "
another security advantage offered by the electronic residence permit , says security expert hans-peter uhl , will be the ability to determine the " true identity of illegal immigrants caught applying for asylum with falsified documents . "
“ it will give us reliable data on whether immigrants are registered twice , or even three times , and also how many foreigners enter and leave our country , " uhl told die welt .
the digital identification card will be tested this year and is planned to be introduced at some point during 2011 .
at present , an estimated four million non-eu citizens in germany will require the new document .
turks and american account for the highest portion of that number .

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .
a spokesman for the free democrats , merkel 's junior coalition partner of which westerwelle is the head , confirmed the report but did not comment any further , adding that the two men " wish to keep this a private affair . "
social union , not marriage in germany , gay marriage is not officially recognized by the state , but since the life partnership act of 2001 the country has granted " registered partnerships " for same-sex couples , which provide some but not all the rights of marriage .
westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .
the outspoken vice chancellor and foreign minister is one of several openly gay politicians in germany , which include berlin mayor klaus wowereit , of the opposition liberal social democrats , and former hamburg mayor ole von beust , of merkel 's christian democrats .
neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

bayern were held to a goalless draw by cologne and stuttgart kept the goals coming , beating moenchengladbach 7-0 . although mainz coach thomas tuchel claimed he does not look at the league tables much , fans are bound to celebrate the fact that their club has moved to the top of the bundesliga table for the first time ever , after beating bremen 2-0 this saturday .
marcel risse and andre schuerrle scored the goals for mainz , both in the second half , giving the club maximum points on the league table .
" i ca n't remember us ever playing worse than today , " bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted after the match .
bremen manager klaus allofs said the match " was too bad to be true . "
no rhythm for bayern last year 's champions bayern munich did not have much to celebrate at the start of oktoberfest .
they were held to a goalless draw by cologne at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern have yet to get into the swing of things " we 're lacking creativity , there 's no rhythm , " said defender phillip lahm after the match .
bayern have had their worst start to the season for 33 years , with only a paltry two goals under their belt so far .
although superior to cologne in terms of ball possession and chances , bayern could not penetrate cologne 's strong defense .
pressure is mounting now to win against hoffenheim on tuesday .
moenchengladbach thrashed stuttgart broke their losing streak in style , with a 7-0 goal-scoring fest against moenchengladbach , which included a hat-trick by russia striker pavel pogrebniak .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart kept those goals coming moenchengladbach , who suffered the worst ever away defeat in the history of the bundesliga , seemed to fall apart completely in the second half .
" we were n't a team today at all , it was a case of none against 11 , " defender tobias levels said after the match .
in saturday 's other matches , wolfsburg collected much-needed points with a 2-0 win against hanover .
an overhead kick by diego put the wolves in the lead in the 55th minute and edin dzeko 's goal 12 minutes later sealed the deal .
hoffenheim drew 2-2 with kaiserslautern and , on friday , freiburg beat frankfurt 1-0 .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .

"
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "
no going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banks were inundated with east germans wanting to exchange their ostmarks monetary union was pushed through without further ado , despite some reservations at the bundesbank .
on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 18.09.2010 german-german monetary union caused economic shockwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many east germans were happy to adopt the d-mark the deutschmark was introduced as the official currency of east germany on july 1 , 1990 , replacing the east german mark and paving the way for unification three months later . by spring 1990 , east germans were once again taking to the streets , the " we are the people " slogan of the peaceful revolution of autumn 1989 replaced by another : " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! "
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "
no going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banks were inundated with east germans wanting to exchange their ostmarks monetary union was pushed through without further ado , despite some reservations at the bundesbank .
on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .
but factory closures and high unemployment sparked a political dispute that remains unresolved to this day .
" the treuhand made arbitrary decisions , " said gregor gysi .
" the agency decided which companies received help and which did n't .
they looked for buyers for some firms and ignored others .
i once asked the treuhand president which criteria they used , and she could n't give me an answer . "
theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .
" but it was down to the companies themselves to find the buyers and the international market share to be able to survive . "
many simply went under , and 20 years on , eastern germany is still waiting for the economic upswing which the currency union was designed to trigger .

for 20 years andre hunger fought to keep it alive .
he has finally given up . andre hunger pours a cup of tea which he says comes from malaysia .
the former personnel manager of mz converted from coffee to tea back in the mid-1990s when an asian investor took over the saxony motorbike company .
it was not a liaison that lasted , and when they pulled out , they took hunger 's hopes for the company 's survival with them .
he says it became apparent that the company was dependent on the decisions of people " somewhere in malaysia , a long way from what was going on and who did n't understand the tradition . "
from the point of their departure , it has downhill all the way . downhill never used to be an issue for the zschopau motorbike manufacturers , whose advertising slogan back in the 1920s was " goes uphill as fast as others go down . " during the gdr era , there were times when annual production exceeded 100,000 and the light , robust , two-stroke engines were commonplace in the eastern bloc and countries in the developing world .
in the 1920s and again in the 1980s the mz motorcycle company , which was founded in 1906 , was the largest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business as usual at the zschopau factory in 1971 in the local museum dedicated to the company , visitors can watch old television reports about the glory days of motorbike sports , in which mz drivers took on honda drivers and the gdr team won the six days trials , the toughest in the world , on mzs .
such prestige made the company a dream workplace for many , including andre hunger , who first joined its ranks in 1988 .
there was never any doubt that that was where the young man who learned about bikes from his grandfather wanted to work new prospects when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the gdr collapsed shortly thereafter , the then 28-year-old mechanical engineer regarded reunification and the market economy as a positive challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre hunger fought hard for survival " we thought everything would get better , without the shortages we had always struggled with .
we thought it was our chance to finally prove what we were made of , " andre hunger said .
like everyone else , he forewent 10 percent of his wages in order to help the company forge ahead , and in 1990 his co-workers elected him to the works council .
but it was n't long before the dream of making a splash in unified germany turned into a nightmare .
sales dropped , and in 1992 mz was forced to file its first petition for bankruptcy .
as a member of the works council , hunger had to rubber stamp a radical redundancy plan that reduced the 3,000-plus workforce to one of just a few hundred .
taking the blame hunger will never forget the trauma of the early 1990s .
he recalls going shopping and bumping into a man who had once worked at the factory .
" his daughter wanted a chocolate father christmas , but the man told her he could n't buy it because he was unemployed , " hunger said .
" and then he pointed at me and said : ' it 's because of that man there that i do n't have a job . '
everyone looked at me and i just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me . " andre hunger says the real guilty party was the treuhand privatization agency set up to oversee the transition from a planned to a market economy .
he believes there were people in the agency connected to west german companies who were keen to crush any competition from east german businesses before they could become a real threat .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

germany is planning to introduce a digital identification card for foreigners in a move to combat illegal immigration .
the id card is only for non-eu citizens living in germany , according to a newspaper report . non-eu citizens living in germany - including turks , americans and swiss - who do not possess a german passport may soon be forced to issue their fingerprints to german authorities , according to a newspaper report published on saturday .
german daily die welt reported that , beginning next year , all foreigners in germany from outside the european union would be required to carry a digital identification card .
the credit-card-sized document is planned to contain the person 's digitized finger prints and photograph and be valid for a maximum of ten years .
' effective means ' to fighting illegal immigration die welt quotes sources from the interior ministry saying the id card will be a " means to combating and preventing illegal immigration " as authorities will be able to " determine the identity of persons without having to refer to any databases . "
another security advantage offered by the electronic residence permit , says security expert hans-peter uhl , will be the ability to determine the " true identity of illegal immigrants caught applying for asylum with falsified documents . "
“ it will give us reliable data on whether immigrants are registered twice , or even three times , and also how many foreigners enter and leave our country , " uhl told die welt .
the digital identification card will be tested this year and is planned to be introduced at some point during 2011 .
at present , an estimated four million non-eu citizens in germany will require the new document .
turks and american account for the highest portion of that number .

the government says the election was a success despite taliban attacks . afghans headed to polls on saturday in the country 's second democratic election since nato 's 2001 invasion .
the afghan government said that the elections were a success , despite taliban attacks on various polling stations .
" despite the heightened threats and despite utmost efforts which were put in place to prevent the afghan people from going to polling stations ... the elections were held in a nearly normal situation throughout the country , " waheed omar , chief spokesman for president hamid karzai , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 40 percent of the electorate were thought to have taken part in the vote german foreign minister guido westerwelle condemned the election day violence and praised the courage of afghan voters .
" i can only praise with the most complete respect this courage , given the very difficult circumstances of the poll , " he said on saturday evening . westerwelle said that although it was too early to give a verdict on the validity of the election process , there was evidence " that these polls were carried out better than many people feared they would be . " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen pledged that the military alliance would continue to support afghanistan and its newly elected parliament . " nato will continue its engagement on behalf of afghanistan , as the people and government create a secure future for themselves and one that will also bolster international security , " rasmussen said .
taliban attacks a series of attacks at polling stations throughout the country killed at least 11 civilians .
the taliban said on their website after polls closed that they had conducted more than 150 attacks .
but , overall , there were fewer attacks than during the presidential elections last year and many were foiled .
afghan security forces worked in tandem with nato troops , among them around 4,000 german forces to combat the taliban " promise " that it would use violence to impede the election .
bildunterschrift : thousands of afghan security forces defended polling stations on saturday dangerous vote around 92 percent of the country 's polling stations were open for voting on saturday , ahmad manawi , head of the independent election commission , said .
the rest were in areas considered too dangerous to hold a vote in , particularly in the south of the country , where the taliban are based .
stressing that it was not a final figure , manawi said 3,642,444 votes had been cast at 4,632 polling centers .
" this makes 40 percent of the maximum number of voters , " he said .
final results are not expected before the end of october .
around 12.5 million people are voting to appoint 249 parliamentarians in an election that is seen as a crucial measure of afghanistan 's push for democracy in the face of the country 's growing insurgent threat .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a later mz model but he is not keen on the idea , which does n't sit well with his understanding of a motorcycle factory .
" that 's why i left , " he said .
he is unwilling to say more on the subject for fear that his words could be interpreted locally as betrayal of the old company . the former works council member and long-time head of personnel stopped working at mz in august 2009 , and has now been experiencing interviews from the other side of the desk .
he says he has sent off some 50 applications and is sick of hearing politicians spout their " clever talk " about the lengths to which the unemployed are supposed to go in order to find work . " they have no idea what it means for a person who has led an active life , " hunger said .
" it 's very bitter when you realize they do n't need you any more . "
during the conversation , his telephone rang .
it was a personnel department interested in his application .
but he is not going to let his hopes run away with him .
at least not yet .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .

virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .

in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .
the only way to face this continuing aggression is to remain united .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .
a spokesman for the free democrats , merkel 's junior coalition partner of which westerwelle is the head , confirmed the report but did not comment any further , adding that the two men " wish to keep this a private affair . "
social union , not marriage in germany , gay marriage is not officially recognized by the state , but since the life partnership act of 2001 the country has granted " registered partnerships " for same-sex couples , which provide some but not all the rights of marriage .
westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .
the outspoken vice chancellor and foreign minister is one of several openly gay politicians in germany , which include berlin mayor klaus wowereit , of the opposition liberal social democrats , and former hamburg mayor ole von beust , of merkel 's christian democrats .
neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

but perhaps those taking the greatest risks are the 410 female candidates .
dw spoke to one of them . independent female candidate shukria serat wali zada is seeking election to parliament for the first time .
she graduated in medicine from the university of kabul and is head of the institute for afghan women 's affairs .
dw : in recent weeks several attacks by the taliban have been reported against officers linked to the electoral process , especially against women running as parliamentary candidates .
what has been your personal experience so far ?
shukria serat wali zada : i know very well what it means to be a woman in afghanistan and nothing catches me by surprise .
i have been threatened by telephone with death on several occasions while our colleagues in herat and ghazni have been beaten .
the tension is constant , and not just between candidates but also among all those who work voluntarily in the campaign .
we know we can be attacked at any time , anywhere .
you are running as a candidate for parliament but you 're far from being positive about the transparency of the whole process .
is it actually worth taking such risks ?
i have to accept the risk because i can not sit idle while i witness a new " pirate landing " in the afghan parliament .
i do not mind dying if it helps to improve the situation of my people .
recent reports regarding the transparency of the elections are rather pessimistic .
do you think we 'll see a similar scenario to that of last year 's presidential elections ?
unfortunately i think so .
the previous elections were embarrassing but , again , it 's all because of the lack of preparation of most of our leaders .
the future of international aid for reconstruction and the presence of coalition troops are heavily dependent on the outcome of these elections .
and this is something we should all be aware of on saturday .
how do you view the current parliament ?
the main problem of today ´ s parliament is that the majority of the seats were occupied by people who lacked any formal training for their position .
and among these people i include " warlords , " tribal leaders and obscure " entrepreneurs " who only sought their own benefit .
virtually none of the parliamentarians had any vocation to defend the interests of their people .
their bad behaviour has only worsened the situation in the country .
if i were elected , my number one priority would be to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling and not just stealing .
what is your opinion of the alleged corruption among the higher echelons of government that has been widely reported ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zada 's priority is to leave the power in the hands of people capable of ruling corruption is endemic in my country for the reasons i mentioned before .
in any case , i think the government is not corrupt in itself .
-lrb- president hamid -rrb- karzai is a very capable leader and he is working hard to unite the afghan people .
in fact , he is the only one who has ever managed to bring leaders from all national , linguistic and ideological background around a single table .
president karzai has also shown his willingness to negotiate with some sectors among the taliban .
do you think that this gesture may help to stabilize the country ?
first of all we should remember that the afghan taliban are far from being a homogeneous group .
most of them haven ´ t studied in a madrasa and many are just simple farmers who have lost their land or their families and have taken up arms for revenge , or simply because they receive a salary to do so at the end of the month .
hamid karzai is an intelligent man who has reached out to those who want to integrate into the new afghan society .
if he ´ s successful , the changes shall be enormous at all levels .
however , would n't negotiations with the taliban be detrimental to the fundamental rights of afghan women ?
under no circumstances will we allow afghan women to remain invisible under a chador .
you can be generous with those who lay down their arms as long as they accept some minimal but very basic rules .
certain groups disenchanted with the current afghan government say the only solution to the problems of the country faces is to split up and divide afghanistan .
what is your view ? by no means should we accept the division of our own country .
we afghans are a people with over 500 years of common history and strong identity feeling .
i am tajik and i speak dari , my neighbor may be pashtun , uzbek , hazara or turkmen , but ask any of them and all of them will tell you that they are afghans .
if by any circumstance any foreign agent ever tried to divide the country our people would rise up in jihad against them without hesitating .
the proof is that neither the british nor the soviets managed to conquer us .
even in the pashtun tribal areas of pakistan they are defining themselves as " afghans ; " how could we possibly deny that we 're all afghan ?
is it possible to achieve stability in pakistan without cooperation from tehran and islamabad ?
unfortunately , both iran and pakistan have their own agenda in afghanistan which obviously does not coincide with kabul ´ s one .
iran has historically extended its influence in the west , among the shia hazara community whereas pakistan has been backing the taliban , all of them sunnis , in the east .

organizers say around 100,000 people took part . at least 30,000 people marched through the streets of berlin to voice their anger over the government 's decision to keep nuclear reactors in use beyond a deadline set by the previous government .
the demonstration was organized by various environmental and anti-nuclear groups , with high-ranking politicians from opposition parties also taking part .
people formed a human chain around germany 's parliament building , the reichstag , and the chancellery , while using whistles and hooters to stage a " nuclear alarm . "
there was also a rally at berlin 's central railway station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests were organized by environmental groups " we will show the government that it wo n't get very far with its nuclear energy policy , " said one of the organizers jochen stay .
huge turnout organizers say around 100,000 people took part in the demonstrations , far more than expected .
the police say , there were at least 40,000 protestors .
the previous government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current governing coalition of angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the free democratic party now wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
the opposition parties as well as environmental and some renewable energy groups accuse the government of pandering to the big energy providers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no permanent storage facility for nuclear waste " the government 's decision to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors is a dirty deal and it favors companies like rwe , e.on , enbw and vattenfall , " juergen trittin , the head of the greens in parliament and former environment minister , said at the rally .
but the government defended its policy on saturday , accusing the opposition parties of playing into people 's fear of atomic energy without offering real solutions .
" back then , the former governing coalition of greens and social democrats decided to turn its back on nuclear energy without thinking it through , " hermann groehe , secretary general of the christian democrats said on saturday .
" they simply shut out any thoughts on where our energy will come from in future and where we 're going to store atomic waste , " he added .

for 20 years andre hunger fought to keep it alive .
he has finally given up . andre hunger pours a cup of tea which he says comes from malaysia .
the former personnel manager of mz converted from coffee to tea back in the mid-1990s when an asian investor took over the saxony motorbike company .
it was not a liaison that lasted , and when they pulled out , they took hunger 's hopes for the company 's survival with them .
he says it became apparent that the company was dependent on the decisions of people " somewhere in malaysia , a long way from what was going on and who did n't understand the tradition . "
from the point of their departure , it has downhill all the way . downhill never used to be an issue for the zschopau motorbike manufacturers , whose advertising slogan back in the 1920s was " goes uphill as fast as others go down . " during the gdr era , there were times when annual production exceeded 100,000 and the light , robust , two-stroke engines were commonplace in the eastern bloc and countries in the developing world .
in the 1920s and again in the 1980s the mz motorcycle company , which was founded in 1906 , was the largest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business as usual at the zschopau factory in 1971 in the local museum dedicated to the company , visitors can watch old television reports about the glory days of motorbike sports , in which mz drivers took on honda drivers and the gdr team won the six days trials , the toughest in the world , on mzs .
such prestige made the company a dream workplace for many , including andre hunger , who first joined its ranks in 1988 .
there was never any doubt that that was where the young man who learned about bikes from his grandfather wanted to work new prospects when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the gdr collapsed shortly thereafter , the then 28-year-old mechanical engineer regarded reunification and the market economy as a positive challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre hunger fought hard for survival " we thought everything would get better , without the shortages we had always struggled with .
we thought it was our chance to finally prove what we were made of , " andre hunger said .
like everyone else , he forewent 10 percent of his wages in order to help the company forge ahead , and in 1990 his co-workers elected him to the works council .
but it was n't long before the dream of making a splash in unified germany turned into a nightmare .
sales dropped , and in 1992 mz was forced to file its first petition for bankruptcy .
as a member of the works council , hunger had to rubber stamp a radical redundancy plan that reduced the 3,000-plus workforce to one of just a few hundred .
taking the blame hunger will never forget the trauma of the early 1990s .
he recalls going shopping and bumping into a man who had once worked at the factory .
" his daughter wanted a chocolate father christmas , but the man told her he could n't buy it because he was unemployed , " hunger said .
" and then he pointed at me and said : ' it 's because of that man there that i do n't have a job . '
everyone looked at me and i just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me . " andre hunger says the real guilty party was the treuhand privatization agency set up to oversee the transition from a planned to a market economy .
he believes there were people in the agency connected to west german companies who were keen to crush any competition from east german businesses before they could become a real threat .
" we were told we had to learn how to work properly .
the treuhand absolutely did not want anything to remain in tact , " hunger recalls , adding that the privatization agency was responsible for the death of many traditional companies that could have survived .
enough is enough after two decades of fighting to survive , there is not much left of mz anymore .
the company no longer manufactures bikes , and the factory floor currently accommodates a meager handful of people building electric scooters and bicycles with electric engines .
hunger says the new owners , two former motorbike racing drivers , plan to import chinese models and sell them under the mz trademark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a later mz model but he is not keen on the idea , which does n't sit well with his understanding of a motorcycle factory .
" that 's why i left , " he said .
he is unwilling to say more on the subject for fear that his words could be interpreted locally as betrayal of the old company . the former works council member and long-time head of personnel stopped working at mz in august 2009 , and has now been experiencing interviews from the other side of the desk .
he says he has sent off some 50 applications and is sick of hearing politicians spout their " clever talk " about the lengths to which the unemployed are supposed to go in order to find work . " they have no idea what it means for a person who has led an active life , " hunger said .
" it 's very bitter when you realize they do n't need you any more . "
during the conversation , his telephone rang .
it was a personnel department interested in his application .
but he is not going to let his hopes run away with him .
at least not yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 18.09.2010 german-german monetary union caused economic shockwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many east germans were happy to adopt the d-mark the deutschmark was introduced as the official currency of east germany on july 1 , 1990 , replacing the east german mark and paving the way for unification three months later . by spring 1990 , east germans were once again taking to the streets , the " we are the people " slogan of the peaceful revolution of autumn 1989 replaced by another : " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! "
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "
no going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banks were inundated with east germans wanting to exchange their ostmarks monetary union was pushed through without further ado , despite some reservations at the bundesbank .
on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .
but factory closures and high unemployment sparked a political dispute that remains unresolved to this day .
" the treuhand made arbitrary decisions , " said gregor gysi .
" the agency decided which companies received help and which did n't .
they looked for buyers for some firms and ignored others .
i once asked the treuhand president which criteria they used , and she could n't give me an answer . "
theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .
" but it was down to the companies themselves to find the buyers and the international market share to be able to survive . "
many simply went under , and 20 years on , eastern germany is still waiting for the economic upswing which the currency union was designed to trigger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 18.09.2010 postcard from europe : technology overtakes prague 's taxi drivers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taxi ride in prague may not leave a good impression taxi drivers in prague have developed a reputation for ripping off customers .
but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

for 20 years andre hunger fought to keep it alive .
he has finally given up . andre hunger pours a cup of tea which he says comes from malaysia .
the former personnel manager of mz converted from coffee to tea back in the mid-1990s when an asian investor took over the saxony motorbike company .
it was not a liaison that lasted , and when they pulled out , they took hunger 's hopes for the company 's survival with them .
he says it became apparent that the company was dependent on the decisions of people " somewhere in malaysia , a long way from what was going on and who did n't understand the tradition . "
from the point of their departure , it has downhill all the way . downhill never used to be an issue for the zschopau motorbike manufacturers , whose advertising slogan back in the 1920s was " goes uphill as fast as others go down . " during the gdr era , there were times when annual production exceeded 100,000 and the light , robust , two-stroke engines were commonplace in the eastern bloc and countries in the developing world .
in the 1920s and again in the 1980s the mz motorcycle company , which was founded in 1906 , was the largest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business as usual at the zschopau factory in 1971 in the local museum dedicated to the company , visitors can watch old television reports about the glory days of motorbike sports , in which mz drivers took on honda drivers and the gdr team won the six days trials , the toughest in the world , on mzs .
such prestige made the company a dream workplace for many , including andre hunger , who first joined its ranks in 1988 .
there was never any doubt that that was where the young man who learned about bikes from his grandfather wanted to work new prospects when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and the gdr collapsed shortly thereafter , the then 28-year-old mechanical engineer regarded reunification and the market economy as a positive challenge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre hunger fought hard for survival " we thought everything would get better , without the shortages we had always struggled with .
we thought it was our chance to finally prove what we were made of , " andre hunger said .
like everyone else , he forewent 10 percent of his wages in order to help the company forge ahead , and in 1990 his co-workers elected him to the works council .
but it was n't long before the dream of making a splash in unified germany turned into a nightmare .
sales dropped , and in 1992 mz was forced to file its first petition for bankruptcy .
as a member of the works council , hunger had to rubber stamp a radical redundancy plan that reduced the 3,000-plus workforce to one of just a few hundred .
taking the blame hunger will never forget the trauma of the early 1990s .
he recalls going shopping and bumping into a man who had once worked at the factory .
" his daughter wanted a chocolate father christmas , but the man told her he could n't buy it because he was unemployed , " hunger said .
" and then he pointed at me and said : ' it 's because of that man there that i do n't have a job . '
everyone looked at me and i just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me . " andre hunger says the real guilty party was the treuhand privatization agency set up to oversee the transition from a planned to a market economy .
he believes there were people in the agency connected to west german companies who were keen to crush any competition from east german businesses before they could become a real threat .
" we were told we had to learn how to work properly .
the treuhand absolutely did not want anything to remain in tact , " hunger recalls , adding that the privatization agency was responsible for the death of many traditional companies that could have survived .
enough is enough after two decades of fighting to survive , there is not much left of mz anymore .
the company no longer manufactures bikes , and the factory floor currently accommodates a meager handful of people building electric scooters and bicycles with electric engines .
hunger says the new owners , two former motorbike racing drivers , plan to import chinese models and sell them under the mz trademark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a later mz model but he is not keen on the idea , which does n't sit well with his understanding of a motorcycle factory .
" that 's why i left , " he said .
he is unwilling to say more on the subject for fear that his words could be interpreted locally as betrayal of the old company . the former works council member and long-time head of personnel stopped working at mz in august 2009 , and has now been experiencing interviews from the other side of the desk .
he says he has sent off some 50 applications and is sick of hearing politicians spout their " clever talk " about the lengths to which the unemployed are supposed to go in order to find work . " they have no idea what it means for a person who has led an active life , " hunger said .
" it 's very bitter when you realize they do n't need you any more . "
during the conversation , his telephone rang .
it was a personnel department interested in his application .
but he is not going to let his hopes run away with him .
at least not yet .

but a czech it firm has come up with a novel solution .
rob cameron explains how in this postcard from prague . let 's get one thing absolutely straight .
the bad old days of mass taxi rip-offs are over .
long gone are the times when even long-term residents of this fair city - even czechs themselves - feared for their wallet every time they opened the door of a cab .
i speak fluent czech and have been ripped off countless times as my cab driver took off on an erratic , seemingly random route to the airport , or the main station , or wherever .
one of my friends was ripped off on his wedding day .
we spent half an hour arguing with the fleet of drivers who wanted vastly inflated sums for what should have been a simple trip from prague 's old town square to a hotel in the suburbs .
tales abound of semi-legal and completely illegal methods of ripping off customers - including special turbo boosters hidden under the steering wheel that could send a taxi meter spinning into the stratosphere at the touch of a button .
according to one story , a driver even had the back seat rigged up to give electric shocks to passengers who refused to pay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern technology might put the breaks on the city 's rogue taxi drivers no , it 's just not like that anymore .
most taxi firms advertise their rates clearly on car doors , taxi stands , posters and websites .
you can order cabs via sms , email , or by phone in english , german , french and many other languages besides .
the notorious airport taxis which once fleeced incoming tourists with depressing regularity have been tamed and now offer standard prices to the city centre - at least the ones queuing directly outside the terminal building .
so the easiest way to avoid getting ripped off is to order a taxi beforehand using the methods outlined above .
hail one on the street , however , and that 's another story .
unfortunately this is just how many people - especially visitors from cities such as london , new york or berlin - get around .
in prague it can be a fateful mistake .
the cobbled streets are still patrolled by hundreds of dodgy taxis preying on innocent victims , their owners little more than petty criminals with a cab licence .
now a czech it firm , et netera , has come up with a method which could deal with even the most notorious abusers .
it says it 's developed a smart phone application that uses gps to measure distance and calculate the proper fare .
called the ' virtual meter ' , the free app calls a cab from a list of approved firms , calculates the distance and displays the projected fare .
all the customer has to do is sit back , watch the display , and enjoy the ride .
et netera says it 's offered the system to prague city hall after one of its foreign business partners was ripped off in a cab .
the application will make it possible to report offenders to the authorities on the spot , and even call a special city hall helpline .
plans for a related facebook page are also afoot .
the system would be a first in europe .
then again , nowhere else in europe do taxi drivers have such a bad reputation , although perhaps , as i 've explained , that 's no longer really justified .
and who knows , if they can develop an app to uncover crooked cab drivers , maybe they can apply the same technology to the exchange offices which fleece thousands of tourists on a daily basis , as the city fathers look embarrassed and say " sorry , our hands our tied . "

though germany does not recognize gay marriage , same-sex couples can enter " registered partnerships . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle formalized his social union with his long-time partner on friday evening in bonn , german mass circulation paper bild reported .
according to the paper the marriage was pronounced by the mayor of bonn , with only close family members and friends present .
a spokesman for the free democrats , merkel 's junior coalition partner of which westerwelle is the head , confirmed the report but did not comment any further , adding that the two men " wish to keep this a private affair . "
social union , not marriage in germany , gay marriage is not officially recognized by the state , but since the life partnership act of 2001 the country has granted " registered partnerships " for same-sex couples , which provide some but not all the rights of marriage .
westerwelle , 48 , has been together with 43-year-old michael mronz , a sporting events organizer , since 2003 .
he made his sexuality public a year later , during a dinner to celebrate chancellor merkel 's 50th birthday .
the outspoken vice chancellor and foreign minister is one of several openly gay politicians in germany , which include berlin mayor klaus wowereit , of the opposition liberal social democrats , and former hamburg mayor ole von beust , of merkel 's christian democrats .
neither wowereit nor von beust have registered their respective relationship with the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 18.09.2010 german-german monetary union caused economic shockwaves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many east germans were happy to adopt the d-mark the deutschmark was introduced as the official currency of east germany on july 1 , 1990 , replacing the east german mark and paving the way for unification three months later . by spring 1990 , east germans were once again taking to the streets , the " we are the people " slogan of the peaceful revolution of autumn 1989 replaced by another : " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! "
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "
no going back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banks were inundated with east germans wanting to exchange their ostmarks monetary union was pushed through without further ado , despite some reservations at the bundesbank .
on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .
" the biggest problem was people 's hopes and expectations , " he says .
" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "
the losers of the currency union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is still lagging behind the western states many of the run-down east german companies collapsed .
the government privatization agency treuhand was set up , aiming to privatize state-run companies .
but factory closures and high unemployment sparked a political dispute that remains unresolved to this day .
" the treuhand made arbitrary decisions , " said gregor gysi .
" the agency decided which companies received help and which did n't .
they looked for buyers for some firms and ignored others .
i once asked the treuhand president which criteria they used , and she could n't give me an answer . "
theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .
" but it was down to the companies themselves to find the buyers and the international market share to be able to survive . "
many simply went under , and 20 years on , eastern germany is still waiting for the economic upswing which the currency union was designed to trigger .

"
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .
we had no time to lose . "

on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .
" i thought it was unfortunate that it was n't more considered , " said ernst woll , a vet who lived in erfurt and was approaching retirement in 1990 . he was skeptical of the german-german monetary union .
" many people in the former east germany were a bit misty-eyed about west germany , and especially its currency , " he recalls .
economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .
" it was strange paying for everyday items with western money , " remembers gregor gysi , who was chairman of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- at the time .
" we would save our deutschmarks for something special .
we did n't spend them on bread rolls or gas or a cup of coffee . "
wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .
he soon realized the new currency would n't only bring buying power - but also huge economic problems .

" the public should have been told that they were starting at a relatively low level and that when productivity was increased , they would start to see improvements .
the mistake was to try and match the standard of living in the west as quickly as possible . "
what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
" because wages were now paid in deutschmarks it meant east german products were no longer so cheap , " explained wilfried fuhrmann .
" that meant that companies lost out to the competition from the west . "

theo waigel , the former german finance minister , says that only the fittest survived .
" we gave capital to the companies with viable prospects so that they could restructure , " he said .

it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .

"
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .

on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .

they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .

"
it was no empty threat .
since the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , hundreds of thousands had emigrated to the west , and the leadership of both germanies were forced to make some speedy decisions .
looking back , west germany 's then finance minister theo waigel said their options were limited .
" i do n't think we would have managed to make people stay in the east , " he told dw .
" we 'd have seen a mass exodus .
some four million people had gone west after 1949 and again after 1989 .

on july 1 , 1990 , at the stroke of midnight , people gathered outside the banks to stand in line to exchange their east german marks for the long awaited hard currency .
an average of 4,000 marks was exchanged per person at an exchange rate of 1 to 1 .
until then , they had been exchanging up to 11 east german marks for one deutschmark on the black market .
moreover , pensions , wages and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged overnight on the same one-to-one basis .
the switch was welcomed by private citizens , even though many were aware that the exchange rate hardly reflected the economic reality .

economic fall-out but by then , it was obvious there was no going back . like everyone else , east germany 's politicians found it hard getting used to the new currency .

wilfried fuhrmann is a monetary expert and economist at potsdam university and witnessed the introduction of the deutschmark in east germany first-hand .

what happened was that east germans went on a huge spending spree .
at long last , they were free to travel to the west and to buy western products .
they left east german goods on the shelves , and never looked back .
the effect on the economy was devastating .
east german manufacturers lost almost all their customers overnight - and competitors from the west were n't the only problem .
