airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

the country will now hold a referendum on the issue . the so-called icesave bill was designed to compensate governments who were forced to bail out their citizens with accounts in the failed icesave bank after parent landesbanki collapsed .
the bill would have forced the icelandic government to pay out 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- to the dutch and british governments .
iceland 's parliament narrowly approved the bill at the end of december . but more than 60,000 voters - about a quarter of the tiny country 's electorate - signed a petition opposing the bill and calling for a referendum .
icelandic president olafur ragnar grimsson has now given in to the demands .

berlin denies knowledge of the cia 's operation . federal prosecutors in hamburg are investigating claims that the cia secretly plotted to assassinate a syrian-german suspected al-qaeda financier living in hamburg .
in its january issue , us magazine vanity fair reported that the american intelligence agency secretly dispatched a hit team to hamburg in 2004 to spy on and assassinate businessman mamoun darkazanli , 51 .
a spokesman for the hamburg prosecutors office said it has launched an investigation into possible wrongdoing .
the magazine article states the cia team , composed of employees of the private security firm blackwater , did not inform german authorities of their presence .
the german government has denied any knowledge of the operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly spied on darkazanli for weeks without informing german authorities but some opposition politicians are skeptical of the government 's ignorance .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele said it was the government 's job to monitor foreign intelligence agencies in germany .
" it ca n't be true that they knew nothing , " stroebele told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt .
alleged 9/11 connections the united states has long held that darkazanli helped finance al qaeda and had connections to the hamburg-based terrorist cell that carried out the september 11 attacks .
he has repeatedly denied the allegations .
german authorities themselves investigated darkazanli for years but never brought charges against him .
police arrested him in october 2004 on a spanish extradition request , but he was released on court order nine months later. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute comes as spain calls for better relations between the island and the eu . spain is demanding answers from cuba over the country 's decision to refuse entry to a european parliamentarian who flew there on holiday .
the dispute comes days after spain took over presidency of the european union with a controversial promise that it would try to improve relations with the caribbean state .
cuban authorities denied entry to luis yanez , a european parliamentarian for spain 's ruling socialist party , when he arrived by air in havana on monday .
he and his wife carmen hermosin , a national parliamentarian for the same party , had travel visas to enter the country .
although hermosin was granted permission to enter the country , she returned with her husband to spain .
no explanation given a spanish diplomatic source said cuba offered " no explanation " for the decision .
yanez had no official agenda in the country , according to the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's foreign minister said the refusal was unjustified spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos described the refusal as " unjustified . "
spain 's secretary of state for latin america , juan pablo de laiglesia , has asked the cuban embassy in madrid to explain the decision .
moratinos has said that spain , which has held the rotating presidency of the european union since friday , will try to normalize relations between the eu and cuba .
better relations sought madrid is seeking a new bilateral agreement on eu-cuba ties , despite objections from sweden and the czech republic as well as human rights groups from the former spanish colony .
yanez is the president for european delegations dealing with the latin american trade group mercosur and a member of europe 's parliamentary assembly for european and latin american relations .
despite improved relations between brussels and havana , the eu remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
in august last year , cuba summoned ambassadors from five eu countries to complain about a visit by their diplomats to prominent cuban dissident darsi ferrer. rc / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute comes as spain calls for better relations between the island and the eu . spain is demanding answers from cuba over the country 's decision to refuse entry to a european parliamentarian who flew there on holiday .
the dispute comes days after spain took over presidency of the european union with a controversial promise that it would try to improve relations with the caribbean state .
cuban authorities denied entry to luis yanez , a european parliamentarian for spain 's ruling socialist party , when he arrived by air in havana on monday .
he and his wife carmen hermosin , a national parliamentarian for the same party , had travel visas to enter the country .
although hermosin was granted permission to enter the country , she returned with her husband to spain .
no explanation given a spanish diplomatic source said cuba offered " no explanation " for the decision .
yanez had no official agenda in the country , according to the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's foreign minister said the refusal was unjustified spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos described the refusal as " unjustified . "
spain 's secretary of state for latin america , juan pablo de laiglesia , has asked the cuban embassy in madrid to explain the decision .
moratinos has said that spain , which has held the rotating presidency of the european union since friday , will try to normalize relations between the eu and cuba .
better relations sought madrid is seeking a new bilateral agreement on eu-cuba ties , despite objections from sweden and the czech republic as well as human rights groups from the former spanish colony .
yanez is the president for european delegations dealing with the latin american trade group mercosur and a member of europe 's parliamentary assembly for european and latin american relations .
despite improved relations between brussels and havana , the eu remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .

" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .

short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .

but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 05.01.2010 german job market weathers recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market got relatively lucky last year german unemployment rose significantly last year , new figures released tuesday revealed , but the feared explosion in unemployment did not materialize .
but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some customers at major banks including postbank , commerzbank and the state-owned sparkasse outlets have found that their cards no longer work , as software on telling machines can not recognise the year 2010 .
" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .

" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .
telling machines have either been rejecting , or even swallowing , valid debit and credit cards , wrongly presuming them to have expired .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

the 66-year-old had clashed with german foreign minister guido westerwelle who opposed her appointment to the board of the federal foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
westerwelle feared steinbach 's appointment could strain germany 's relations with its eastern neighbors , in particular poland . steinbach remains unpopular there because of her forceful backing of the interests of german world war ii refugees .
as a member of the parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , steinbach once voted against recognising germany 's current border with poland .

" the political debate in recent months over the bdv 's decision to appoint its president to the museum board is without parallel , embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy , " steinbach said in a statement .
" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has kept out of the controversy so far politicians split germany 's major political parties have been divided in their reaction to steinbach 's withdrawal .
“ i will of course look at every proposal that is fair , realistic and constructive , ” foreign minister westerwelle told german radio station deutschlandfunk . he said the aim was only to ensure “ that relations between germany and poland were not damaged . ”
but the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , backed steinbach . " now we have the chance to find a new constitution for the foundation , " hans-peter friedrich , head of the csu 's national committee said .

it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .

william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .

communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

the 66-year-old had clashed with german foreign minister guido westerwelle who opposed her appointment to the board of the federal foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
westerwelle feared steinbach 's appointment could strain germany 's relations with its eastern neighbors , in particular poland . steinbach remains unpopular there because of her forceful backing of the interests of german world war ii refugees .
as a member of the parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , steinbach once voted against recognising germany 's current border with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister westerwelle was opposed to steinbach 's appointment " embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy " but on tuesday , the 66-year-old head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- said on tuesday she would drop her bid if the cabinet gave up its power to veto appointees .
" the political debate in recent months over the bdv 's decision to appoint its president to the museum board is without parallel , embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy , " steinbach said in a statement .
" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has kept out of the controversy so far politicians split germany 's major political parties have been divided in their reaction to steinbach 's withdrawal .
“ i will of course look at every proposal that is fair , realistic and constructive , ” foreign minister westerwelle told german radio station deutschlandfunk . he said the aim was only to ensure “ that relations between germany and poland were not damaged . ”
but the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , backed steinbach . " now we have the chance to find a new constitution for the foundation , " hans-peter friedrich , head of the csu 's national committee said .
but opposition parties called on the government to stick to the constitution that the previous german government had agreed on .
green party leader renate kuenast called steinbach 's proposal " absolutely unacceptable , " and demanded that chancellor angela merkel intervene. bk / kna / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .

short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .

while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .

but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .

short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2010 move over iphone , here comes google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new google phone is being billed as a threat to apple 's market share techies the world over have their glazed eyes turned towards california on tuesday , as they await the mighty google to reveal its own smartphone .
but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "
market overload ?
that being the case , how is google 's new baby going to fare once it comes out from behind its veil ?
bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .

communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .

" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 05.01.2010 istanbul to energize artists , architecture as cultural capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul is one of three 2010 european capitals of culture the turkish city straddling the east and west is hoping to dazzle the world with its reign as one of europe 's capitals of culture . istanbul is one of europe 's three cultural capitals for 2010 . along with the ruhr region in germany and pecs , hungary , the turkish city has been designated by the european union as a center of cultural activity for the next 12 months .
but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
follow the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the cultural capital program is too arbitrary and commercial but critics are questioning how the 150-million-euro budget -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- is being spent .
most of the original steering committee resigned en masse , accusing the islamic-rooted government of pushing its political agenda . allegations of corruption continue to grow .
the organizers admit that only 12 percent of the budget has been allocated to art and festivals , while 70 percent is being spent on restoring historical buildings , mainly mosques .

resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "

while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

officials say the problem is similar to the " y2k " bug . officials are calling a software glitch that has rendered millions of german atm cards useless " a year 2010 problem . "
some customers at major banks including postbank , commerzbank and the state-owned sparkasse outlets have found that their cards no longer work , as software on telling machines can not recognise the year 2010 .
" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .
telling machines have either been rejecting , or even swallowing , valid debit and credit cards , wrongly presuming them to have expired .
as german banks scramble to update their atms , the dsvg says the problem should be solved domestically by next week .
however , germans looking to withdraw money abroad may experience problems for longer .
customers trying to pay by card in shops have also experienced sporadic difficulties .
delayed y2k bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern microchip debit and credit cards are the ones affected by the bug this is a similar problem to the now infamous " y2k " or " millennium bug " that many feared would bring the world to its knees with the advent of the year 2000 .
in reality , however , its effect was minimal .
the dsgv estimates that roughly 20 million of the 45 million ec -lrb- " euro-cheque " -rrb- debit cards , and about 3.5 million of 8 million credit cards whose pertinent data is stored in a microchip rather than magnetic strip are affected .
many cards have different software and are not a problem .
the dsvg also said that some of the more up to date telling machines are able to deal even with the faulty cards .
germany is slowly phasing in modern microchip credit and debit cards . the changeover from the old magnetic strip technology is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has kept out of the controversy so far politicians split germany 's major political parties have been divided in their reaction to steinbach 's withdrawal .

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
follow the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the cultural capital program is too arbitrary and commercial but critics are questioning how the 150-million-euro budget -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- is being spent .
most of the original steering committee resigned en masse , accusing the islamic-rooted government of pushing its political agenda . allegations of corruption continue to grow .
the organizers admit that only 12 percent of the budget has been allocated to art and festivals , while 70 percent is being spent on restoring historical buildings , mainly mosques .
but there is little disagreement that one of the most popular events will be the multi-million-dollar firework displays , which are set to run throughout the year .
the first will be on january 16 , the official start of the event .

bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .

so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

the 66-year-old had clashed with german foreign minister guido westerwelle who opposed her appointment to the board of the federal foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
westerwelle feared steinbach 's appointment could strain germany 's relations with its eastern neighbors , in particular poland . steinbach remains unpopular there because of her forceful backing of the interests of german world war ii refugees .
as a member of the parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , steinbach once voted against recognising germany 's current border with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister westerwelle was opposed to steinbach 's appointment " embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy " but on tuesday , the 66-year-old head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- said on tuesday she would drop her bid if the cabinet gave up its power to veto appointees .
" the political debate in recent months over the bdv 's decision to appoint its president to the museum board is without parallel , embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy , " steinbach said in a statement .
" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .

his murder is believed to be connected with his investigations into organized crime in the country . bulgarian interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov said the journalist was shot dead in central sofia in broad daylight .
two other men were also wounded and rushed to hospital .
it 's the first such killing since a new center-right government took office in july .
tsankov , 30 , was a radio presenter and author of several books on organized crime in bulgaria .
he had previously been injured in 2006 by a bomb attack outside of his home , and received death threats last november shortly before one of his books was published .
pressure to crack down on crime the bulgarian government of prime minister boiko borisov is under pressure both at home and from the european union to deliver on its pledge to crack down on organized crime and corrupt officials .
there have been more than 150 gangland-style killings since 2001 .
however , few of the killings have resulted in trials , and even fewer suspects have been convicted .
since the fall of communism , only one crime boss has been sent to jail in bulgaria .
tsankov 's murder comes after the death of another crime author .
gerogi stoev had been planning to release a book with detailed descriptions of bulgarian organized crime activities , when he was shot and killed in april 2008 .
the european union has repeatedly criticized bulgaria , which has been an eu member since 2007 , for its corrupt and inefficient justice system .
the bloc cut millions of euros in aid in 2008 , and may impose more sanctions if no signs of improvement are seen. mk / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
follow the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the cultural capital program is too arbitrary and commercial but critics are questioning how the 150-million-euro budget -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- is being spent .
most of the original steering committee resigned en masse , accusing the islamic-rooted government of pushing its political agenda . allegations of corruption continue to grow .
the organizers admit that only 12 percent of the budget has been allocated to art and festivals , while 70 percent is being spent on restoring historical buildings , mainly mosques .
but there is little disagreement that one of the most popular events will be the multi-million-dollar firework displays , which are set to run throughout the year .
the first will be on january 16 , the official start of the event .

but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "
market overload ?
that being the case , how is google 's new baby going to fare once it comes out from behind its veil ?
bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 05.01.2010 german job market weathers recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market got relatively lucky last year german unemployment rose significantly last year , new figures released tuesday revealed , but the feared explosion in unemployment did not materialize .
but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

officials say the problem is similar to the " y2k " bug . officials are calling a software glitch that has rendered millions of german atm cards useless " a year 2010 problem . "
some customers at major banks including postbank , commerzbank and the state-owned sparkasse outlets have found that their cards no longer work , as software on telling machines can not recognise the year 2010 .
" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .
telling machines have either been rejecting , or even swallowing , valid debit and credit cards , wrongly presuming them to have expired .
as german banks scramble to update their atms , the dsvg says the problem should be solved domestically by next week .
however , germans looking to withdraw money abroad may experience problems for longer .
customers trying to pay by card in shops have also experienced sporadic difficulties .
delayed y2k bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern microchip debit and credit cards are the ones affected by the bug this is a similar problem to the now infamous " y2k " or " millennium bug " that many feared would bring the world to its knees with the advent of the year 2000 .
in reality , however , its effect was minimal .
the dsgv estimates that roughly 20 million of the 45 million ec -lrb- " euro-cheque " -rrb- debit cards , and about 3.5 million of 8 million credit cards whose pertinent data is stored in a microchip rather than magnetic strip are affected .
many cards have different software and are not a problem .
the dsvg also said that some of the more up to date telling machines are able to deal even with the faulty cards .
germany is slowly phasing in modern microchip credit and debit cards . the changeover from the old magnetic strip technology is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 05.01.2010 german job market weathers recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market got relatively lucky last year german unemployment rose significantly last year , new figures released tuesday revealed , but the feared explosion in unemployment did not materialize .
but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2010 move over iphone , here comes google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new google phone is being billed as a threat to apple 's market share techies the world over have their glazed eyes turned towards california on tuesday , as they await the mighty google to reveal its own smartphone .
but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "
market overload ?
that being the case , how is google 's new baby going to fare once it comes out from behind its veil ?
bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "

" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "

apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .

german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .

while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 05.01.2010 airbus considers grounding its military transport plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a400m military transporter could bite the dust airbus no longer rules out ending production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the state-of-the-art military airlifter refuse to share ballooning costs . after its long-awaited maiden flight in december , europe 's state-of-the-art airbus a400m military airlifter could find itself showcased in a museum if government buyers do n't agree to help shoulder the burden of the program 's huge cost overruns .
airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 05.01.2010 german job market weathers recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market got relatively lucky last year german unemployment rose significantly last year , new figures released tuesday revealed , but the feared explosion in unemployment did not materialize .
but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .

officials say the problem is similar to the " y2k " bug . officials are calling a software glitch that has rendered millions of german atm cards useless " a year 2010 problem . "
some customers at major banks including postbank , commerzbank and the state-owned sparkasse outlets have found that their cards no longer work , as software on telling machines can not recognise the year 2010 .
" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .
telling machines have either been rejecting , or even swallowing , valid debit and credit cards , wrongly presuming them to have expired .
as german banks scramble to update their atms , the dsvg says the problem should be solved domestically by next week .
however , germans looking to withdraw money abroad may experience problems for longer .
customers trying to pay by card in shops have also experienced sporadic difficulties .
delayed y2k bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern microchip debit and credit cards are the ones affected by the bug this is a similar problem to the now infamous " y2k " or " millennium bug " that many feared would bring the world to its knees with the advent of the year 2000 .
in reality , however , its effect was minimal .
the dsgv estimates that roughly 20 million of the 45 million ec -lrb- " euro-cheque " -rrb- debit cards , and about 3.5 million of 8 million credit cards whose pertinent data is stored in a microchip rather than magnetic strip are affected .
many cards have different software and are not a problem .
the dsvg also said that some of the more up to date telling machines are able to deal even with the faulty cards .
germany is slowly phasing in modern microchip credit and debit cards . the changeover from the old magnetic strip technology is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country will now hold a referendum on the issue . the so-called icesave bill was designed to compensate governments who were forced to bail out their citizens with accounts in the failed icesave bank after parent landesbanki collapsed .
the bill would have forced the icelandic government to pay out 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- to the dutch and british governments .
iceland 's parliament narrowly approved the bill at the end of december . but more than 60,000 voters - about a quarter of the tiny country 's electorate - signed a petition opposing the bill and calling for a referendum .
icelandic president olafur ragnar grimsson has now given in to the demands .
" it has steadily become more apparent that the people must be convinced that they themselves determine the future course , " grimsson said at a press conference on tuesday .
" the involvement of the whole nation in the final decision is therefore the prerequisite for a successful solution , reconciliation and recovery . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "

bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

the country will now hold a referendum on the issue . the so-called icesave bill was designed to compensate governments who were forced to bail out their citizens with accounts in the failed icesave bank after parent landesbanki collapsed .
the bill would have forced the icelandic government to pay out 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- to the dutch and british governments .
iceland 's parliament narrowly approved the bill at the end of december . but more than 60,000 voters - about a quarter of the tiny country 's electorate - signed a petition opposing the bill and calling for a referendum .
icelandic president olafur ragnar grimsson has now given in to the demands .
" it has steadily become more apparent that the people must be convinced that they themselves determine the future course , " grimsson said at a press conference on tuesday .
" the involvement of the whole nation in the final decision is therefore the prerequisite for a successful solution , reconciliation and recovery . "

its high interest rates attracted savers , and ultimately about 320,000 dutch and british citizens lost money through its collapse .
repaying the lost money has been seen as a prerequisite for iceland 's acceptance to the european union .
rejection by voters could impede the country 's membership bid .
opponents of the bill have claimed its demands are unrealistic and that taxpayers should not be punished for the bank 's mistakes .
the payouts would amount to about 12,000 euros for each icelandic citizen. acb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .

while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .

" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "

" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .

on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .

the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .

the 66-year-old had clashed with german foreign minister guido westerwelle who opposed her appointment to the board of the federal foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
westerwelle feared steinbach 's appointment could strain germany 's relations with its eastern neighbors , in particular poland . steinbach remains unpopular there because of her forceful backing of the interests of german world war ii refugees .
as a member of the parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , steinbach once voted against recognising germany 's current border with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister westerwelle was opposed to steinbach 's appointment " embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy " but on tuesday , the 66-year-old head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- said on tuesday she would drop her bid if the cabinet gave up its power to veto appointees .
" the political debate in recent months over the bdv 's decision to appoint its president to the museum board is without parallel , embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy , " steinbach said in a statement .
" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has kept out of the controversy so far politicians split germany 's major political parties have been divided in their reaction to steinbach 's withdrawal .
“ i will of course look at every proposal that is fair , realistic and constructive , ” foreign minister westerwelle told german radio station deutschlandfunk . he said the aim was only to ensure “ that relations between germany and poland were not damaged . ”
but the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , backed steinbach . " now we have the chance to find a new constitution for the foundation , " hans-peter friedrich , head of the csu 's national committee said .
but opposition parties called on the government to stick to the constitution that the previous german government had agreed on .
green party leader renate kuenast called steinbach 's proposal " absolutely unacceptable , " and demanded that chancellor angela merkel intervene. bk / kna / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say the problem is similar to the " y2k " bug . officials are calling a software glitch that has rendered millions of german atm cards useless " a year 2010 problem . "
some customers at major banks including postbank , commerzbank and the state-owned sparkasse outlets have found that their cards no longer work , as software on telling machines can not recognise the year 2010 .
" a piece of software on the affected cards , programmed by our suppliers , is defective , and can not correctly recognize this year 's number , 2010 , " the german dsgv banking association said on tuesday .
telling machines have either been rejecting , or even swallowing , valid debit and credit cards , wrongly presuming them to have expired .

but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .

short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2010 europe plans massive north sea grid for renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea 's wind farms could meet 10 percent of europe 's energy needs it 's set to be the biggest transnational power network of its kind .
europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

berlin denies knowledge of the cia 's operation . federal prosecutors in hamburg are investigating claims that the cia secretly plotted to assassinate a syrian-german suspected al-qaeda financier living in hamburg .
in its january issue , us magazine vanity fair reported that the american intelligence agency secretly dispatched a hit team to hamburg in 2004 to spy on and assassinate businessman mamoun darkazanli , 51 .
a spokesman for the hamburg prosecutors office said it has launched an investigation into possible wrongdoing .
the magazine article states the cia team , composed of employees of the private security firm blackwater , did not inform german authorities of their presence .
the german government has denied any knowledge of the operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly spied on darkazanli for weeks without informing german authorities but some opposition politicians are skeptical of the government 's ignorance .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele said it was the government 's job to monitor foreign intelligence agencies in germany .
" it ca n't be true that they knew nothing , " stroebele told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt .
alleged 9/11 connections the united states has long held that darkazanli helped finance al qaeda and had connections to the hamburg-based terrorist cell that carried out the september 11 attacks .
he has repeatedly denied the allegations .
german authorities themselves investigated darkazanli for years but never brought charges against him .
police arrested him in october 2004 on a spanish extradition request , but he was released on court order nine months later. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 05.01.2010 german job market weathers recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the job market got relatively lucky last year german unemployment rose significantly last year , new figures released tuesday revealed , but the feared explosion in unemployment did not materialize .
but experts warned that 2010 could still bring further job losses . unemployment in germany averaged 8.2 percent of the workforce last year , with a total of 3.42 million unemployed , the federal labor agency said tuesday .
that represented an increase from the 2008 level of 7.8 percent , a trend that was also seen month-on-month .
the raw number of jobless in the country in december 2009 was 3,276,000 , and experts expected a further rise in january .
" after three months of declining unemployment numbers , it was only a matter of time before german unemployment would increase again , " ing senior economist carsten brzeski said .
" unemployment should continue to increase until mid-2010 and should peak at around 3.8 million , " the economist predicted , which he noted would be well below the peak of 5.2 million generated by germany 's last recession in 2002-2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subsidized short-term contracts saved a lot of jobs " despite the deep recession , the labour market in 2009 remained robust , " federal labor agency chief frank-juergen weise said .
he added that while the jobless numbers rose last year , the increase was not as much as feared .
short-time work saves the figures one the main reasons for the relatively good news is a short-time work scheme that has kept more than a million workers on state-subsidized reduced-hour payrolls . data also shows that germany benefited from a net increase in new companies last year .
the government-subsidized contracts have helped german employers avoid large-scale layoffs as a result of what has been the nation 's steepest economic slowdown in a generation .
but weise predicted that the number of employees on short-term contracts will total about 600,000 this year , which is about 400,000 less than in 2009 .
while berlin has announced it was planning to extend the subsidized contracts scheme for another year , it has limited the subsidy support to 18 months , instead of a previous allowance of 24 months .
germany 's relatively rigid labor market and the government 's boost appears to have averted a sharp rise in unemployment amid the global economic slowdown , but " whether such a labor market can be a growth driver during the recovery is another story , " brzeski said .
" however , with the improving economic outlook , gradually filling order books and increasing demand for new labor , it looks as if the threat of exploding unemployment rates has been averted , " he said. bk / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
follow the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the cultural capital program is too arbitrary and commercial but critics are questioning how the 150-million-euro budget -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- is being spent .
most of the original steering committee resigned en masse , accusing the islamic-rooted government of pushing its political agenda . allegations of corruption continue to grow .
the organizers admit that only 12 percent of the budget has been allocated to art and festivals , while 70 percent is being spent on restoring historical buildings , mainly mosques .
but there is little disagreement that one of the most popular events will be the multi-million-dollar firework displays , which are set to run throughout the year .
the first will be on january 16 , the official start of the event .

but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "
market overload ?
that being the case , how is google 's new baby going to fare once it comes out from behind its veil ?
bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 05.01.2010 istanbul to energize artists , architecture as cultural capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul is one of three 2010 european capitals of culture the turkish city straddling the east and west is hoping to dazzle the world with its reign as one of europe 's capitals of culture . istanbul is one of europe 's three cultural capitals for 2010 . along with the ruhr region in germany and pecs , hungary , the turkish city has been designated by the european union as a center of cultural activity for the next 12 months .
but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
follow the money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the cultural capital program is too arbitrary and commercial but critics are questioning how the 150-million-euro budget -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- is being spent .
most of the original steering committee resigned en masse , accusing the islamic-rooted government of pushing its political agenda . allegations of corruption continue to grow .
the organizers admit that only 12 percent of the budget has been allocated to art and festivals , while 70 percent is being spent on restoring historical buildings , mainly mosques .
but there is little disagreement that one of the most popular events will be the multi-million-dollar firework displays , which are set to run throughout the year .
the first will be on january 16 , the official start of the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 05.01.2010 un reform process mired by lack of consensus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perceived failure at copenhagen has led some to clamor for reform the united nations is in dire need of reform , everyone agrees .
but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .

a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .

" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

but a french court on tuesday ruled the evidence provided by motor sport 's governing body , fia , was too weak .
it said briatore 's lawyers were unable to question witnesses who gave their evidence anonymously .
briatore was awarded 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- in compensation .
however , he has demanded the fia pay him an additional one million euros in damages .

" in the past renault has demonstrated that it is one of the top teams in formula one and i am sure that with hard work and determination we can challenge at the front once again , " bouiller said in a statement .
bouiller says he plans to work with bob bell , who acted as stand-in principal after briatore , on the sporting and performance aspects of the team. mk / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "

while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

the dispute comes as spain calls for better relations between the island and the eu . spain is demanding answers from cuba over the country 's decision to refuse entry to a european parliamentarian who flew there on holiday .
the dispute comes days after spain took over presidency of the european union with a controversial promise that it would try to improve relations with the caribbean state .
cuban authorities denied entry to luis yanez , a european parliamentarian for spain 's ruling socialist party , when he arrived by air in havana on monday .
he and his wife carmen hermosin , a national parliamentarian for the same party , had travel visas to enter the country .
although hermosin was granted permission to enter the country , she returned with her husband to spain .
no explanation given a spanish diplomatic source said cuba offered " no explanation " for the decision .
yanez had no official agenda in the country , according to the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's foreign minister said the refusal was unjustified spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos described the refusal as " unjustified . "
spain 's secretary of state for latin america , juan pablo de laiglesia , has asked the cuban embassy in madrid to explain the decision .
moratinos has said that spain , which has held the rotating presidency of the european union since friday , will try to normalize relations between the eu and cuba .
better relations sought madrid is seeking a new bilateral agreement on eu-cuba ties , despite objections from sweden and the czech republic as well as human rights groups from the former spanish colony .
yanez is the president for european delegations dealing with the latin american trade group mercosur and a member of europe 's parliamentary assembly for european and latin american relations .
despite improved relations between brussels and havana , the eu remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 05.01.2010 airbus considers grounding its military transport plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a400m military transporter could bite the dust airbus no longer rules out ending production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the state-of-the-art military airlifter refuse to share ballooning costs . after its long-awaited maiden flight in december , europe 's state-of-the-art airbus a400m military airlifter could find itself showcased in a museum if government buyers do n't agree to help shoulder the burden of the program 's huge cost overruns .
airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

but a french court on tuesday ruled the evidence provided by motor sport 's governing body , fia , was too weak .
it said briatore 's lawyers were unable to question witnesses who gave their evidence anonymously .
briatore was awarded 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- in compensation .
however , he has demanded the fia pay him an additional one million euros in damages .
new head for renault f1 meanwhile , renault announced tuesday that frenchman eric bouiller will be taking over the renault formula one team .
the 36-year-old has no formula one experience , but he has managed the dams team in the junior gp2 series .
he also ran the french entry in the a1 gp championship .
" in the past renault has demonstrated that it is one of the top teams in formula one and i am sure that with hard work and determination we can challenge at the front once again , " bouiller said in a statement .
bouiller says he plans to work with bob bell , who acted as stand-in principal after briatore , on the sporting and performance aspects of the team. mk / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2010 move over iphone , here comes google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new google phone is being billed as a threat to apple 's market share techies the world over have their glazed eyes turned towards california on tuesday , as they await the mighty google to reveal its own smartphone .
but do we really need what many say is essentially more of the same ? the date for the launch of nexus one , as the google device is called , has been the subject of wild speculation for quite some time , but with media outfits receiving invitations to an " android press gathering , " it is widely believed that , come the close of business on tuesday , the guess work will be over .
it is not the internet search engine 's first foray into cell phone technology .
the company made its debut in 2008 when it lent its android mobile operating system to t-mobile 's g1 .
but the nexus one is the first smartphone that google will be calling its own and there is clearly a lot of interest .
that said , some of those who have had a sneak preview - among them google employees - are not falling over themselves with enthusiasm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is not content to be just a search engine in a detailed review of the phone , joshua topolsky wrote on his technology blog , engadget , that it was essentially just another android smartphone .
" it 's a particularly good one , " he said .
" it 's certainly up there with the best of its breed - but it 's not in any way the earth-shattering , paradigm-skewing device the media and community cheerleaders have built it up to be . "
market overload ?
that being the case , how is google 's new baby going to fare once it comes out from behind its veil ?
bildunterschrift : mobile phone expert , lutz herkner told deutsche welle that the phone has been over-hyped and has the potential to leave a taste of disappointment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight in the modern world " because it is google , people are really expecting something great , but the phone is not a revolution , " he said .
" i would have thought they would have done something more innovative like push their own service . "
but so far , all the talk is of google on the outside rather than the inside of the phone .
in fact , besides a different and some say better aesthetic , the word seems to be that the nexus one will not offer anything vastly different to the iphone .
boxing gloves are off one could then be tempted to ask if there is really a need for more gadgets that do the same things as their predecessors .
william higham , consumer trend consultant at the next big thing in london says google versus apple is like the rolling stones versus the beatles and that both have a place in 21st century society .
" smartphones have become the things in our lives that matter , " higham told deutsche welle .
" we are persuaded we want one , and when we discover them , we keep finding new ways to use them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' apps ' mania .
apple has sold somewhere in the region of 2 billion never a truer word was spoken .
on the bus , at the beach , at work , in the garden , up a hill , pretty much wherever one looks , there is someone not too far away with their head bent over a smartphone .
but it is not as if email or facebook or twitter or wikipedia or other web content that users can access on smartphones is dazzlingly new , so just what is it about the technology that has convinced so many people that they need to spend hours on end cooing over their shiny little boxes ?
communication 24/7 citing polls taken during times of economic hardship , higham claims that what people increasingly want from their smartphones is the ability to communicate with family and friends for comparatively little money .
and this , they can do .
as for social mores , higham says they are bound to undergo a period of adjustment while society adapts to the technology currently running it .
but he insists that all the talk about the glory of ' apps ' will ultimately fizzle out .
" at the moment there is some rudeness , people play with their phones at dinner , but that will stop , " the trend consultant said .
" people will ultimately adapt , they will put the baby back in the cot and talk to their friends . "
but until such time , there is likely a lot more chatting and tweeting to be done on the subject of who has which phone .
and at least some it will start when google presents its nexus one to the wider public .

europe is planning a massive electricity grid to run under the north sea , connecting different eu countries with each other as well as to clean power . the year 2010 is looking to be a busy one for energy officials in europe as they put together the plans for a multinational north sea electricity grid .
the european commission will publish a blueprint for the grid , after nine european union countries signed an agreement last month to coordinate their national efforts and develop their own plans this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned grid would let eu customers plug into renewables the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that representatives will meet for the first time on february 9 .
" if europe is able to develop a super-grid it will be a vital ingredient in the fight against climate change because it will allow large-scale integration of renewable electricity production , " justin wilkes , policy director of the european wind energy association -lrb- ewea -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
it would also improve europe 's energy independence and have other knock-on benefits .
the eu 's executive has long wanted to see greater integration of the continent 's national grids , and the north sea project will be a big step in the direction of a single energy market . renewable super-grid such a super-grid would ultimately connect the offshore wind farms in northern europe with the solar panels in southern europe , allowing countries with a surplus of energy to pass it along to countries with higher demand .
" if the wind is n't blowing somewhere , it might be blowing elsewhere , " is how nick rau , energy campaigner for friends of the earth in britain , put it .
both rau and wilkes are convinced a european super-grid will be essential for getting europe to use more renewable energy .
" the european union has over the next few years to make an enormous investment in its electricity grid infrastructure and also its electricity generating technologies , " wilkes said .
" therefore we have an ideal opportunity at the moment to make sure that this investment goes into renewable energies .
better cables make it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grid would link wind , water , wave and solar power providers one problem that has plagued renewable energy to date has been the inconsistency of supply .
a wind park ca n't provide energy if the wind is n't blowing and solar panels are less effective on a cloudy day .
a grid linking various european energy sources would allow that energy to be managed and passed along to areas with the greatest need .
the key technological advance that will make this possible is new cable technology .
new high-voltage direct-current cables lose significantly less energy during transmission than their predecessors , but they 're still quite expensive .
" but if one calculates it correctly beyond a certain distance it 's much more economically viable to be using this high-voltage direct-current technology than current cable technologies , " wilkes said .
wilkes and his colleagues at the ewea have estimated that the cost for the north sea grid could be as high as 30 billion euros over the next 20 years , but the electricity provided should become cheaper for customers .
wind potential in europe 's north energy providers such as germany 's e.on are keen to get in on the action .
currently there are 100 gigawatts of offshore wind power planned by european power companies and developers in the north sea .
e.on has several projects along both the german and british coasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy grids in europe currently operate mostly on a national level e.on spokesman christian drepper told deutsche welle that a grid connecting all the individual projects into one network would be a great idea .
" it makes sense for us just as a customer , " he said .
the north sea grid could play a key role in the eu 's 2020 goals of increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent , cutting greenhouse gases by 20 percent , and bringing down energy use by 20 percent by the year 2020 .
in fact , wilkes said with the wind energy projects currently being planned the eu could easily expand their target of renewable energy use to 30 percent .

his murder is believed to be connected with his investigations into organized crime in the country . bulgarian interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov said the journalist was shot dead in central sofia in broad daylight .
two other men were also wounded and rushed to hospital .
it 's the first such killing since a new center-right government took office in july .
tsankov , 30 , was a radio presenter and author of several books on organized crime in bulgaria .
he had previously been injured in 2006 by a bomb attack outside of his home , and received death threats last november shortly before one of his books was published .
pressure to crack down on crime the bulgarian government of prime minister boiko borisov is under pressure both at home and from the european union to deliver on its pledge to crack down on organized crime and corrupt officials .
there have been more than 150 gangland-style killings since 2001 .
however , few of the killings have resulted in trials , and even fewer suspects have been convicted .
since the fall of communism , only one crime boss has been sent to jail in bulgaria .
tsankov 's murder comes after the death of another crime author .
gerogi stoev had been planning to release a book with detailed descriptions of bulgarian organized crime activities , when he was shot and killed in april 2008 .
the european union has repeatedly criticized bulgaria , which has been an eu member since 2007 , for its corrupt and inefficient justice system .
the bloc cut millions of euros in aid in 2008 , and may impose more sanctions if no signs of improvement are seen. mk / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 66-year-old had clashed with german foreign minister guido westerwelle who opposed her appointment to the board of the federal foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
westerwelle feared steinbach 's appointment could strain germany 's relations with its eastern neighbors , in particular poland . steinbach remains unpopular there because of her forceful backing of the interests of german world war ii refugees .
as a member of the parliament for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , steinbach once voted against recognising germany 's current border with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister westerwelle was opposed to steinbach 's appointment " embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy " but on tuesday , the 66-year-old head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- said on tuesday she would drop her bid if the cabinet gave up its power to veto appointees .
" the political debate in recent months over the bdv 's decision to appoint its president to the museum board is without parallel , embarrassing and unworthy of a democracy , " steinbach said in a statement .
" the character of a nation shows itself in the way it treats the victims of wars and its dead , " she added .
" i want to find a reasonable solution and urge the government to cooperate . "
steinbach 's bdv has been the main driving force behind the creation of a controversial museum dedicated mainly to the fate of the 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has kept out of the controversy so far politicians split germany 's major political parties have been divided in their reaction to steinbach 's withdrawal .
“ i will of course look at every proposal that is fair , realistic and constructive , ” foreign minister westerwelle told german radio station deutschlandfunk . he said the aim was only to ensure “ that relations between germany and poland were not damaged . ”
but the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , backed steinbach . " now we have the chance to find a new constitution for the foundation , " hans-peter friedrich , head of the csu 's national committee said .
but opposition parties called on the government to stick to the constitution that the previous german government had agreed on .
green party leader renate kuenast called steinbach 's proposal " absolutely unacceptable , " and demanded that chancellor angela merkel intervene. bk / kna / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .

despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

the dispute comes as spain calls for better relations between the island and the eu . spain is demanding answers from cuba over the country 's decision to refuse entry to a european parliamentarian who flew there on holiday .
the dispute comes days after spain took over presidency of the european union with a controversial promise that it would try to improve relations with the caribbean state .
cuban authorities denied entry to luis yanez , a european parliamentarian for spain 's ruling socialist party , when he arrived by air in havana on monday .
he and his wife carmen hermosin , a national parliamentarian for the same party , had travel visas to enter the country .
although hermosin was granted permission to enter the country , she returned with her husband to spain .
no explanation given a spanish diplomatic source said cuba offered " no explanation " for the decision .
yanez had no official agenda in the country , according to the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's foreign minister said the refusal was unjustified spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos described the refusal as " unjustified . "
spain 's secretary of state for latin america , juan pablo de laiglesia , has asked the cuban embassy in madrid to explain the decision .
moratinos has said that spain , which has held the rotating presidency of the european union since friday , will try to normalize relations between the eu and cuba .
better relations sought madrid is seeking a new bilateral agreement on eu-cuba ties , despite objections from sweden and the czech republic as well as human rights groups from the former spanish colony .
yanez is the president for european delegations dealing with the latin american trade group mercosur and a member of europe 's parliamentary assembly for european and latin american relations .
despite improved relations between brussels and havana , the eu remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .
in august last year , cuba summoned ambassadors from five eu countries to complain about a visit by their diplomats to prominent cuban dissident darsi ferrer. rc / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

airbus , a subsidiary of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , may cancel production of the a400m if the seven european governments that ordered the plane can not reach a deal on additional funding , toulouse-based airbus spokesman stefan schaffrath told deutsche welle .
" this is a possible scenario , although we are still optimistic about reaching an agreement .
there is much at stake for everyone , " schaffrath said .
airbus has committed 40,000 people to the a400m project - 11,000 of them in germany alone - according to tore prang , a spokesman for airbus in hamburg .
moreover , european air forces have an acute need to replace their aging fleets of transporters .
and the reputation of airbus and its parent company , eads , could suffer greatly if the scheduled fleet of new a400ms never takes off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo thomas enders is pushing for a final decision on a400m funding " substantial loss each month " some say the a400m contract signed in 2003 with seven governments - belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain , turkey and the uk - was flawed from the offset .
it was based on a novel fixed-price system requiring the manufacturer to bear any cost overruns .
" we are making a substantial loss each month , " which the company needs to end , schaffrath said .
in an earlier interview with the german newspaper die welt , airbus president and chief executive officer thomas enders hinted at halting the a400m project , saying the deadlock between the partners had gone on long enough and that the time had come to act .
enders added that he could n't allow one military project to drag down the rest of the company and its civilian projects .
" i did n't think ending the a400m project was an option a while ago but it could be now , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
skodzik warned that european governments would need to find an alternative to the a400m if the airbus program collapsed , and added that they could turn to a major rival in the us .
technical hiccups the a400m is a four-engineered turboprop aircraft , designed to be the most versatile airlifter available in the market .
it can carry around 37 tons of personnel and equipment , including armored vehicles , and land on the rough airfields often found in war or disaster zones . it can also be used to provide in-flight refueling for all types of military aircraft , from fast jets to helicopters .
the a400m 's long list of capabilities , however , has also been one its biggest problems .
technical hiccups in the aircraft 's development put it more than three years behind schedule .
bugs in the highly complex flight management and engine software were among the main reasons for the long delays .
the aircraft 's design also called for a totally new airframe , and the engines had to be designed and built pretty much from scratch .
perhaps most troubling to its planned buyers are concerns that the final bill for the 180 airplanes on order could come in at 25 percent more than the 20 billion euros originally quoted .
airbus officials would not disclose any details about the overrun costs .
eads executives plan to meet with representatives of the seven european governments at the end of january to reach a final decision , after delaying a decision twice before .

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "

but just how these reforms should look , and what a reformed un should achieve , are issues still under debate . the new year presents huge challenges for the international community .
many countries continue to be bogged down in crisis and conflict , including afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo .
and the problem of global warning appears no less daunting than it did before the copenhagen climate conference in december . the un weathered a lot of criticism in the aftermath of copenhagen : the organization was accused of being too slow and cumbersome in decision-making .
criticism of the body 's inability to act is nothing new - for more than a decade , experts have called for fundamental reforms to make the international organization more efficient .
but while there is general agreement on the urgent need for change , the discussion surrounding what reforms should mean in practice is highly controversial .
while some want the un to play a greater role in world affairs in the future , others want its role confined to humanitarian work .
resuscitating the un the structures and operational procedures of the united nations have long been out of sync with the requirements of today 's geopolitical realities .
current un secretary general ban ki moon 's statement in favor of reform is given top billing on the un 's reform website : " i am determined to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened united nations firmly anchored in the 21st century , and which is effective , efficient , coherent and accountable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the un security council lost its legitimacy ?
according to professor andreas paulus from the institute of international law at the university of goettingen , the challenge lies in defining what shape these reforms would take .
the reform agenda is both huge and very complex , he told deutsche welle , highlighting the fact that the un security council is not supposed to pass any laws .
" many say that the security council has some kind of legislative power , and in parts it has really exercised this power , " paulus said .
" that means that the security council – which you could call an institutionalized idea of the major powers – is no longer legitimate . ”
an obsolete model the members of the un security council reflect the power structure of the world as it was in 1945 , after world war ii .
there are five permanent members ; france , great britain , the us , china and russia , as well as 10 non-permanent members elected for terms of two years .
but this has little to do with the realities of the 21st century , paulus said . in 2005 , former un secretary general kofi annan called for the security council to be expanded from 15 to 25 members .
yet nothing has changed in the past five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi anan originally called for un reform in 2005 " the reform process is much , much slower than kofi annan himself believed it would be , " paulus said .
" all in all , i believe that united nations has no other chance to deal with global problems but to become more democratic . "
yet this frequent demand for more democracy raises fundamental questions about the role of the un .
after all , the un is not a world government directly elected by the world 's citizens , but a forum for sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action .
dependence on unanimity professor thomas jaeger , a political scientist at the university of cologne , thinks the question of democracy within the un is one of the key issues when it comes to reform .
" the un depends on consensus among its members .
and there are fundamentally different interests among particular countries , ” jaeger told deutsche welle .
in practice , more democracy might mean that majority decisions could decide courses of action for the un .
that would go against the current system that requires all un members to agree on decisions , effectively granting each nation a veto right .
" as long as there is dissent , as long as there is no consensus among the members , no decision will be taken .
and it is under this requirement that the united nations , as an institution , is stable , ” jaeger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would see the un 's global role limited to managing humanitarian aid achieving stability through a cumbersome decision making process sounds paradoxical , but if unanimous decision making were dropped , it could spell the end of the united nations , he said .
jaeger argued that even the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- countries , which comprise the seven leading industrialized nations and russia , have lost a lot of their importance in recent years .
at the same time , the g-20 , which brings together industrialized states and emerging economies , has gained importance .
" some even speak of a g-2 , namely the united states of america and china .
that means there is a small group of people , who are not democratically legitimized , making the decisions that can not be made by the united nations . ” at the end of 2010 , the next round of un-sponsored climate talks will take place in mexico .
it remains to be seen where the un reform process will stand at that point and whether the international community will indeed be more democratic or effective than it was at the copenhagen conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.01.2010 as transfer prices rise , bundesliga could reap benefit of youth policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga teams nurture talent from a young age as transfer fees continue to go through the roof , the bundesliga could find itself ahead of the pack , should the player market grind to a halt .
soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

soccer could then become reliant on young , homegrown talent . few soccer clubs in 2010 will be able to splash out as much as in previous years .
with top players , such as liverpool striker fernando torres valued at a whopping 158 million euros -lrb- $ 227 million -rrb- costing so much to sign and to sustain , most clubs are increasingly reluctant or unable to shell out the money for the world 's best .
this means that if the player price hike continues as predicted , fewer and fewer world class stars will be on the move .
eventually , the transfer market will grind to a halt , with the top players all huddled together in london , madrid or manchester - or forced to accept their lot at their current clubs .
as the value of players continues to rise , many teams have adopted the philosophy of ' speculate to accumulate ' ; they 're developing their youth systems , nurturing young local talent and buying the potential stars of the future on the cheap .
placing your faith in youngsters is of course not a new trend .
in the english premiership , manchester united 's era of modern dominance was built on a team of fa youth cup winners which featured the likes of david beckham , paul scholes and the neville brothers .
the 1995 title-winning team had an average age of 24 with six first team regulars under 21 .
it laid waste to a pundit 's claim at the time that " you ca n't win anything with kids . "
since then , arsenal 's arsene wenger has taken on the mantle of paternal developer by building successful teams around exciting raw talent .
but there 's one main difference : unlike alex ferguson 's teams of the mid-90s , many of the young guns have come in from other clubs .
more recently , rafael benitez at liverpool circumnavigated his club 's financial malaise by spending pennies on teenagers from south america to eastern europe in the hope of having cut-price world class players in a few years .
german clubs under orders to nurture youth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teams are required to maintain youth teams in germany , the emphasis on youth development has been the cornerstone of the national team 's continued success and the slow but steady rise of the bundesliga through the ranks of the european leagues .
while english , italian and spanish teams were spending millions on snapping up youngsters from africa to asia in the 2006/07 season , bundesliga clubs were inwardly investing a total of 44 million euros in youth academies .
bundesliga clubs are obliged under the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- regulations to manage and maintain youth academies in order to be eligible for the licenses they need to operate in the league .
the dfb regularly does spot-checks on bundesliga clubs to assess their youth programs and make sure they meet its criteria .
this includes fielding a sufficient number of youth teams in a variety of age groups , maintaining adequate training pitches and providing good-quality standards in terms of sporting , medical and educational care for the youngsters .
international success ingrained at an early age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's under17s became european champions in 2009 national coach joachim loew is particularly happy with this approach , especially after germany 's youngsters won the uefa under-17 and uefa under-21 european titles in 2009 .
" the youth academies of the bundesliga are a kind of elite school for the best , and an excellent institution which is bearing fruits , " he said recently .
" numerous excellent players from these academies have managed to go professional already . "
turning to youth out of necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's midfielder toni kroos has just turned 20 the bundesliga clubs are well aware of the value of the german youth system - for example , current league leaders bayer leverkusen have an average age of just 23 .
while the youth system undoubtedly provides teams with capable players , most german clubs are relying on youth out of necessity because most world-class stars ignore the advances of bundesliga .
despite being able to attract the likes of franck ribery , arjen robben and luca toni in recent years , even bayern munich are talking about looking closer to home for the stars of the future .
bayern could turn to homegrown talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's thomas mueller is a star player at 20 bayern did invest heavily in new , established talent during the summer transfer window .
but following a disappointing start to the season under new coach louis van gaal , sporting director christian nerlinger announced that a new emphasis on youth will be at the center of bayern 's transfer policy .
" we 're keeping a close eye on a few of our youngsters who we believe may have the quality to play for bayern munich , " nerlinger told reporters . " they will soon be invited to train with the senior squad , allowing the coaching staff to gain a first-hand impression for themselves .
" on the one hand you have the riberys and tonis , who we need for consistent success , " he added .
" on the other hand , you have players coming out of our superb development system and the squad has plenty of those . "
so , in the event that the world soccer transfer market becomes gridlocked by massive fees , the bundesliga clubs may find themselves ahead of the pack when it comes to sending out their boys to do a man 's job .

the country will now hold a referendum on the issue . the so-called icesave bill was designed to compensate governments who were forced to bail out their citizens with accounts in the failed icesave bank after parent landesbanki collapsed .
the bill would have forced the icelandic government to pay out 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- to the dutch and british governments .
iceland 's parliament narrowly approved the bill at the end of december . but more than 60,000 voters - about a quarter of the tiny country 's electorate - signed a petition opposing the bill and calling for a referendum .
icelandic president olafur ragnar grimsson has now given in to the demands .
" it has steadily become more apparent that the people must be convinced that they themselves determine the future course , " grimsson said at a press conference on tuesday .
" the involvement of the whole nation in the final decision is therefore the prerequisite for a successful solution , reconciliation and recovery . "

its high interest rates attracted savers , and ultimately about 320,000 dutch and british citizens lost money through its collapse .
repaying the lost money has been seen as a prerequisite for iceland 's acceptance to the european union .
rejection by voters could impede the country 's membership bid .
opponents of the bill have claimed its demands are unrealistic and that taxpayers should not be punished for the bank 's mistakes .
the payouts would amount to about 12,000 euros for each icelandic citizen. acb / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin denies knowledge of the cia 's operation . federal prosecutors in hamburg are investigating claims that the cia secretly plotted to assassinate a syrian-german suspected al-qaeda financier living in hamburg .
in its january issue , us magazine vanity fair reported that the american intelligence agency secretly dispatched a hit team to hamburg in 2004 to spy on and assassinate businessman mamoun darkazanli , 51 .
a spokesman for the hamburg prosecutors office said it has launched an investigation into possible wrongdoing .

the german government has denied any knowledge of the operation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly spied on darkazanli for weeks without informing german authorities but some opposition politicians are skeptical of the government 's ignorance .

" it ca n't be true that they knew nothing , " stroebele told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt .
alleged 9/11 connections the united states has long held that darkazanli helped finance al qaeda and had connections to the hamburg-based terrorist cell that carried out the september 11 attacks .
he has repeatedly denied the allegations .
german authorities themselves investigated darkazanli for years but never brought charges against him .
police arrested him in october 2004 on a spanish extradition request , but he was released on court order nine months later. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute comes as spain calls for better relations between the island and the eu . spain is demanding answers from cuba over the country 's decision to refuse entry to a european parliamentarian who flew there on holiday .
the dispute comes days after spain took over presidency of the european union with a controversial promise that it would try to improve relations with the caribbean state .
cuban authorities denied entry to luis yanez , a european parliamentarian for spain 's ruling socialist party , when he arrived by air in havana on monday .
he and his wife carmen hermosin , a national parliamentarian for the same party , had travel visas to enter the country .
although hermosin was granted permission to enter the country , she returned with her husband to spain .
no explanation given a spanish diplomatic source said cuba offered " no explanation " for the decision .
yanez had no official agenda in the country , according to the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's foreign minister said the refusal was unjustified spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos described the refusal as " unjustified . "
spain 's secretary of state for latin america , juan pablo de laiglesia , has asked the cuban embassy in madrid to explain the decision .
moratinos has said that spain , which has held the rotating presidency of the european union since friday , will try to normalize relations between the eu and cuba .
better relations sought madrid is seeking a new bilateral agreement on eu-cuba ties , despite objections from sweden and the czech republic as well as human rights groups from the former spanish colony .
yanez is the president for european delegations dealing with the latin american trade group mercosur and a member of europe 's parliamentary assembly for european and latin american relations .
despite improved relations between brussels and havana , the eu remains concerned about the communist government 's treatment of political opponents .

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .

but with the turkish government allocating a budget that dwarfs its fellow cities ' allowances , the istanbul organizers are already claiming it will be the largest and most successful .
however , the project has become mired in politics and not everyone is buying into the hype .
" energy from istanbul " is the slogan for the festivities . the advertising campaign for istanbul 's reign as a cultural capital highlights the unique location of the city , which bridges the geographical frontier between asia and europe .
images of istanbul 's historical buildings - mosques , palaces and a grand german-built railway station dating back to the end of the ottoman empire - are featured in the campaign . advertisements are being broadcast across europe as well as in turkey , all part of the organizers ' efforts to get europe excited about istanbul .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large portion of the budget is allegedly going into repairing istanbul 's many mosques beral madra , a curator and art critic involved in organizing arts events over the year , was upbeat about istanbul 's year as cultural capital .
she said in an interview with deutsche welle that she was trying to spread the money between as many artists and projects as possible .
aiding artists " most of those artists do n't have money and they ca n't sell their work , " madra said .
" there is no international art scene here ; there are no funds here .
so 2010 gives them a great opportunity . "
several projects are underway , with 12 internationally renowned artists spending a month in istanbul working with young artists .
their work will be displayed later in the year .
hundreds of school art teachers are also being trained .
nearly 500 projects have been commissioned , including documentaries , street theatre productions and concerts , as well as collaborative projects with previous and future cultural capitals . in july orhan pamuk will open his museum of innocence , named after a similarly titled book by the turkish nobel literature laureate .
the museum will take a look at istanbul 's modern history through the author 's eyes .
