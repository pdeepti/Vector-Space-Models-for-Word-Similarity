studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

chief minister nitish kumar is likely to succeed in his bid to win another term in office for the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- . millions voted peacefully thursday at the start of the six-phase assembly poll in bihar where chief minister nitish kumar is facing a tough challenge from a splintered opposition .
there were reports of some early incidents including minor fights between rival groups .
electronic voting machines malfunctioned in a few polling booths while in another area an election official was beaten up .
but for a state notorious for poll related violence , it was a quiet start .
improving conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar nitish kumar , a former engineer , won the election five years ago after promising better infrastructure and development .
to an extent , there has been some improvement in the state 's infrastructure with better roads and electricity supplies .
moreover security for normal citizens , which had been very poor earlier , has also improved .
kumar claims credit for the turnaround .
for decades , bihar , which sends 40 of the 545 lawmakers to the national parliament in delhi , has been lagging behind in terms of most social and economic indicators .
as one of india 's poorest and most corrupt states , politics in bihar has often revolved around caste groups .
and political parties have been quick to exploit the situation .
action instead of empty promises interestingly , the main poll issue is development .
all the political parties have been wooing voters by promising more and better development .
there is a simple explanation : the mindset of voters has changed .
they want action , not empty promises .
more development shivnath jha from madhepura who voted thursday said his village would vote for those who ushered in progress .
" i will vote for a political party that promises us development .
our choice is clear , better our lives and you will get our vote .
development is what we need and that is what we will vote for , " he says .
" candidate who will work for us " similar sentiments were expressed by shambu paswan , a villager : " we will vote for a candidate who will work for us .
not for a person who stands on party loyalities and forgets us after the election .
we won ’ t vote for that person . "
kumar is opposed by a coalition headed by the rashtriya janata dal party whose chief is lalu prasad yadav .
his party once ruled bihar for 15 years before being toppled in 2005 .
split with the bjp ?
a confident lalu prasad said his party would sweep to victory at the elections .
" today the first phase of polling is going on and we are going to sweep the whole of bihar .
nobody can save nitish kumar ’ s government because he has failed on all fronts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bjp leaders anant kumar -lrb- l . -rrb- , arun jaitley and ravi shankar prasad hoping that his work would speak for itself in the past 5 years , kumar spurned an offer from his ally , the bjp , to allow their star campaigner narender modi , the chief minister of gujarat , to campaign for the ruling coalition .
this has sparked rumours of a possible split with the bjp in the event his party wins with a comfortable majority .
kumar has not forgotten that modi was allegedly responsible for the sectarian riots in his state in 2002 that claimed over 1,000 lives .
the main political parties have promised to campaign even harder in the next five rounds of voting .
votes will be counted on november 24 .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now .

this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

chief minister nitish kumar is likely to succeed in his bid to win another term in office for the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- . millions voted peacefully thursday at the start of the six-phase assembly poll in bihar where chief minister nitish kumar is facing a tough challenge from a splintered opposition .
there were reports of some early incidents including minor fights between rival groups .
electronic voting machines malfunctioned in a few polling booths while in another area an election official was beaten up .
but for a state notorious for poll related violence , it was a quiet start .
improving conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar nitish kumar , a former engineer , won the election five years ago after promising better infrastructure and development .
to an extent , there has been some improvement in the state 's infrastructure with better roads and electricity supplies .
moreover security for normal citizens , which had been very poor earlier , has also improved .
kumar claims credit for the turnaround .
for decades , bihar , which sends 40 of the 545 lawmakers to the national parliament in delhi , has been lagging behind in terms of most social and economic indicators .
as one of india 's poorest and most corrupt states , politics in bihar has often revolved around caste groups .
and political parties have been quick to exploit the situation .
action instead of empty promises interestingly , the main poll issue is development .
all the political parties have been wooing voters by promising more and better development .
there is a simple explanation : the mindset of voters has changed .
they want action , not empty promises .
more development shivnath jha from madhepura who voted thursday said his village would vote for those who ushered in progress .
" i will vote for a political party that promises us development .
our choice is clear , better our lives and you will get our vote .
development is what we need and that is what we will vote for , " he says .
" candidate who will work for us " similar sentiments were expressed by shambu paswan , a villager : " we will vote for a candidate who will work for us .
not for a person who stands on party loyalities and forgets us after the election .
we won ’ t vote for that person . "
kumar is opposed by a coalition headed by the rashtriya janata dal party whose chief is lalu prasad yadav .
his party once ruled bihar for 15 years before being toppled in 2005 .
split with the bjp ?
a confident lalu prasad said his party would sweep to victory at the elections .
" today the first phase of polling is going on and we are going to sweep the whole of bihar .
nobody can save nitish kumar ’ s government because he has failed on all fronts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bjp leaders anant kumar -lrb- l . -rrb- , arun jaitley and ravi shankar prasad hoping that his work would speak for itself in the past 5 years , kumar spurned an offer from his ally , the bjp , to allow their star campaigner narender modi , the chief minister of gujarat , to campaign for the ruling coalition .
this has sparked rumours of a possible split with the bjp in the event his party wins with a comfortable majority .
kumar has not forgotten that modi was allegedly responsible for the sectarian riots in his state in 2002 that claimed over 1,000 lives .
the main political parties have promised to campaign even harder in the next five rounds of voting .
votes will be counted on november 24 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 21.10.2010 waiting for the final result großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press conference of afghanistan 's independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .

meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.10.2010 analysts like new porsche chief , but vw tie-up could face delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are taking some of the shine off the vw-porsche deal volkswagen 's planned integration of porsche could be delayed due to lawsuits and taxes , vw said this week .
but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .
porsche has tried to take over the much larger vw by securing stock through options trading , but failed in its bid , while watching its debt triple to more than 10 billion euros .
vw then agreed last year to incorporate porsche into its family of brands , which includes audi , seat , skoda and lamborghini .
volkswagen bought half of porsche 's sports-car business late last year for 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- .
vw has said it wants to acquire the rest of porsche in 2011 .
new man at the helm while vw and porsche continue down the rather pothole-marked road toward a union , they are hoping a new man at the head of porsche can avoid any more unforeseen obstacles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias mueller performed well for audi , and is close to vw chief winterkorn matthias mueller , 57 , got behind the wheel at porsche at the beginning of this month , taking over from michael macht , who took a position on the vw management board , where he is now in charge of group production .
mueller , vw 's top car-model strategist , is expected to spread the success he had at vw 's audi unit to porsche .
analysts say he has the know-how to do it , as well as the support .
mueller is considered close to vw chief winterkorn and still enjoys strong support at porsche headquarters in stuttgart .
" he fits in here .
i especially like the fact that he 's not all talk .
he gets things done , " said uwe hueck , the head of porsche 's works council .
independence mueller has insisted he is not coming to stuttgart to simply do the bidding of executives in wolfsburg , where vw is based .
while wolfsburg will be involved in discussions , he said porsche will not lose its autonomy .
" if we take an active role in running this company , wolfsburg will basically leave us alone .
but if we are passive and just wait for things to happen , they 're going to take control , " mueller said at the paris auto salon last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's panamera sedan has helped sales rebound " but that 's not what they want and not why i am here .
i think they chose me for this position because they believe i can be an active element and work with my colleagues to make things happen . "
although mueller insists that porsche will largely call its own shots , automobile expert willi diez says vw will want to have its say .
mueller 's close ties with volkswagen will make it easier for him to integrate porsche into the group of vw brands .
" i think it 's certainly understandable that vw wants to strengthen its influence at porsche .
they naturally want to have someone at the top that enjoys the trust of the vw board .
also , that he runs things there in a way that volkswagen thinks is right , " he said .
a ' good move ' mueller 's resume , which includes his time as the head of audi 's product management and new model development , makes him well suited for the top job at porsche , according to juergen pieper , an automotive expert at the metzler bank .
" i think this is a good move for porsche , " he said .
" i do n't know mr. mueller personally , but i have heard from reliable sources that he is a very strong motivator , knows his cars and that he 's made a lot of positive things happen , such as at audi where his years there were very good ones .
volkswagen aims to surpass auto giant toyota in deliveries and profitability by 2018 .
its integration of porsche is part of that plan .
porsche , for its part , wants to expand its own line-up to double annual sales in the mid-term to 150,000 cars and sports utility vehicles .

" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 21.10.2010 sense of entitlement wins out in the champions league großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's famous luck came to their rescue against cluj the german football clubs showed once again that league form has little if any bearing on how a team fares in european competition .
somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 21.10.2010 astronomers spot farthest-known galaxy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 million years after the big bang , the universe was in its ' re-ionization ' phase using the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile , a european research team has detected light from the most distant galaxy ever seen - dating back to less than 600 million years after the big bang . in a paper published wednesday in the journal nature , a european research team reported that the newfound galaxy udfy-38185539 is the remotest cosmic object ever recorded .
studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "

the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .

islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .

" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .

" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

the aim is to curb fraud , but food producers are fuming . the german government announced on wednesday the launch of a new website to allow citizens to report food fraud .
the site should be up and running by march , 2011 , according to consumer affairs minister ilse aigner , who said the project was intended to " promote a discourse between the public and the food industry that is long overdue . "
" what 's in a product must be identified on the label , " the minister told reporters in berlin on wednesday , citing a number of examples in which foodstuffs were " fraudulently labeled . "
" a yogurt purporting to contain real fruit , mus n't solely be made of artificial fruit flavoring , " aigner said . " we want to know if people consider this to be a fraud , and if they want us to act against the producer . "
dubious technologies the announcement comes after a series of public revelations about modern technologies used in the growing convenience food market .
aigner demanded more transparency in the food industry , saying producers should call a spade a spade .
the consumer affairs minister said germans should be aware , for example , that the " cheese " on packaged pizzas is often so-called analogue cheese - a mixture of soybeans , nutritional yeasts and other non-dairy ingredients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheese on this pizza may or may not be real even grocery-store versions of the cherished german dish schnitzel were cast in ugly doubt as it became known that some companies produce them from snippets of calf meat held together by an organic glue .
audacious step german consumer advocacy groups welcomed aigner 's decision to make food fraud public .
foodwatch germany considers the government website " to be of essential importance " in its efforts " to make food production more transparent . "
" the government has finally acknowledged that consumers here are being grossly cheated in supermarkets , " said matthias wolfschmidt , a spokesman for the non-profit organisation .
the advocacy groups also hope the decision will rein in labeling fraud in the organic food sector , where sharply rising imports have recently cast doubts on whether the higher-priced foods are really produced in an environmentally friendly manner .
industrial worries germany 's food industry , meanwhile , has come out against the new internet portal , which they have deemed an " unlawful act , which will pillory producers without scientific proof . "
industry representatives say there are already more than enough authorities officially charged with maintaining food security and that any alleged violations " must be sorted out in the courts . "
" it 's impossible for a country based on the rule of law to permit a public internet platform where people who feel cheated are allowed to tarnish -lsb- companies ' -rsb- images " , said andrea moritz , a spokesman for the food industry lobby group , bll .
ministerial determination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner is determined to improve food safety yet consumer affairs minister aigner is determined to push ahead in her drive for more transparency in the food sector .
just last month she announced an initiative to promote hygenic standards in german restaurants .
she said health inspectors would in the future be allowed to paste frowning faces on the doors of restaurants where they have found mouse droppings , mouldy meat or cockroaches , as a way to warn potential customers about hygienic shortcomings .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "

turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 21.10.2010 astronomers spot farthest-known galaxy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 million years after the big bang , the universe was in its ' re-ionization ' phase using the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile , a european research team has detected light from the most distant galaxy ever seen - dating back to less than 600 million years after the big bang . in a paper published wednesday in the journal nature , a european research team reported that the newfound galaxy udfy-38185539 is the remotest cosmic object ever recorded .
studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 21.10.2010 waiting for the final result großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press conference of afghanistan 's independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2010 month-long elections begin in bihar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security officer stands guard , as voters display their election identity cards in the state of bihar the first of the state 's 243 constituencies went to the polls on thursday .
chief minister nitish kumar is likely to succeed in his bid to win another term in office for the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- . millions voted peacefully thursday at the start of the six-phase assembly poll in bihar where chief minister nitish kumar is facing a tough challenge from a splintered opposition .
there were reports of some early incidents including minor fights between rival groups .
electronic voting machines malfunctioned in a few polling booths while in another area an election official was beaten up .
but for a state notorious for poll related violence , it was a quiet start .
improving conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar nitish kumar , a former engineer , won the election five years ago after promising better infrastructure and development .
to an extent , there has been some improvement in the state 's infrastructure with better roads and electricity supplies .
moreover security for normal citizens , which had been very poor earlier , has also improved .
kumar claims credit for the turnaround .
for decades , bihar , which sends 40 of the 545 lawmakers to the national parliament in delhi , has been lagging behind in terms of most social and economic indicators .
as one of india 's poorest and most corrupt states , politics in bihar has often revolved around caste groups .
and political parties have been quick to exploit the situation .
action instead of empty promises interestingly , the main poll issue is development .
all the political parties have been wooing voters by promising more and better development .
there is a simple explanation : the mindset of voters has changed .
they want action , not empty promises .
more development shivnath jha from madhepura who voted thursday said his village would vote for those who ushered in progress .
" i will vote for a political party that promises us development .
our choice is clear , better our lives and you will get our vote .
development is what we need and that is what we will vote for , " he says .
" candidate who will work for us " similar sentiments were expressed by shambu paswan , a villager : " we will vote for a candidate who will work for us .
not for a person who stands on party loyalities and forgets us after the election .
we won ’ t vote for that person . "
kumar is opposed by a coalition headed by the rashtriya janata dal party whose chief is lalu prasad yadav .
his party once ruled bihar for 15 years before being toppled in 2005 .
split with the bjp ?
a confident lalu prasad said his party would sweep to victory at the elections .
" today the first phase of polling is going on and we are going to sweep the whole of bihar .
nobody can save nitish kumar ’ s government because he has failed on all fronts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bjp leaders anant kumar -lrb- l . -rrb- , arun jaitley and ravi shankar prasad hoping that his work would speak for itself in the past 5 years , kumar spurned an offer from his ally , the bjp , to allow their star campaigner narender modi , the chief minister of gujarat , to campaign for the ruling coalition .
this has sparked rumours of a possible split with the bjp in the event his party wins with a comfortable majority .
kumar has not forgotten that modi was allegedly responsible for the sectarian riots in his state in 2002 that claimed over 1,000 lives .
the main political parties have promised to campaign even harder in the next five rounds of voting .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer protection -pipe- 21.10.2010 germany calls on its population to ' pillory ' food fraud on special website großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labels on packaged foods may be misleading consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is planning to launch an internet platform on which people will be able to report fraudulently labeled food products .
the aim is to curb fraud , but food producers are fuming . the german government announced on wednesday the launch of a new website to allow citizens to report food fraud .
the site should be up and running by march , 2011 , according to consumer affairs minister ilse aigner , who said the project was intended to " promote a discourse between the public and the food industry that is long overdue . "
" what 's in a product must be identified on the label , " the minister told reporters in berlin on wednesday , citing a number of examples in which foodstuffs were " fraudulently labeled . "
" a yogurt purporting to contain real fruit , mus n't solely be made of artificial fruit flavoring , " aigner said . " we want to know if people consider this to be a fraud , and if they want us to act against the producer . "
dubious technologies the announcement comes after a series of public revelations about modern technologies used in the growing convenience food market .
aigner demanded more transparency in the food industry , saying producers should call a spade a spade .
the consumer affairs minister said germans should be aware , for example , that the " cheese " on packaged pizzas is often so-called analogue cheese - a mixture of soybeans , nutritional yeasts and other non-dairy ingredients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheese on this pizza may or may not be real even grocery-store versions of the cherished german dish schnitzel were cast in ugly doubt as it became known that some companies produce them from snippets of calf meat held together by an organic glue .
audacious step german consumer advocacy groups welcomed aigner 's decision to make food fraud public .
foodwatch germany considers the government website " to be of essential importance " in its efforts " to make food production more transparent . "
" the government has finally acknowledged that consumers here are being grossly cheated in supermarkets , " said matthias wolfschmidt , a spokesman for the non-profit organisation .
the advocacy groups also hope the decision will rein in labeling fraud in the organic food sector , where sharply rising imports have recently cast doubts on whether the higher-priced foods are really produced in an environmentally friendly manner .
industrial worries germany 's food industry , meanwhile , has come out against the new internet portal , which they have deemed an " unlawful act , which will pillory producers without scientific proof . "
industry representatives say there are already more than enough authorities officially charged with maintaining food security and that any alleged violations " must be sorted out in the courts . "
" it 's impossible for a country based on the rule of law to permit a public internet platform where people who feel cheated are allowed to tarnish -lsb- companies ' -rsb- images " , said andrea moritz , a spokesman for the food industry lobby group , bll .
ministerial determination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner is determined to improve food safety yet consumer affairs minister aigner is determined to push ahead in her drive for more transparency in the food sector .
just last month she announced an initiative to promote hygenic standards in german restaurants .
she said health inspectors would in the future be allowed to paste frowning faces on the doors of restaurants where they have found mouse droppings , mouldy meat or cockroaches , as a way to warn potential customers about hygienic shortcomings .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 21.10.2010 astronomers spot farthest-known galaxy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 million years after the big bang , the universe was in its ' re-ionization ' phase using the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile , a european research team has detected light from the most distant galaxy ever seen - dating back to less than 600 million years after the big bang . in a paper published wednesday in the journal nature , a european research team reported that the newfound galaxy udfy-38185539 is the remotest cosmic object ever recorded .
studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .
porsche has tried to take over the much larger vw by securing stock through options trading , but failed in its bid , while watching its debt triple to more than 10 billion euros .
vw then agreed last year to incorporate porsche into its family of brands , which includes audi , seat , skoda and lamborghini .
volkswagen bought half of porsche 's sports-car business late last year for 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- .
vw has said it wants to acquire the rest of porsche in 2011 .
new man at the helm while vw and porsche continue down the rather pothole-marked road toward a union , they are hoping a new man at the head of porsche can avoid any more unforeseen obstacles .

mueller , vw 's top car-model strategist , is expected to spread the success he had at vw 's audi unit to porsche .
analysts say he has the know-how to do it , as well as the support .
mueller is considered close to vw chief winterkorn and still enjoys strong support at porsche headquarters in stuttgart .
" he fits in here .
i especially like the fact that he 's not all talk .
he gets things done , " said uwe hueck , the head of porsche 's works council .
independence mueller has insisted he is not coming to stuttgart to simply do the bidding of executives in wolfsburg , where vw is based .
while wolfsburg will be involved in discussions , he said porsche will not lose its autonomy .
" if we take an active role in running this company , wolfsburg will basically leave us alone .
but if we are passive and just wait for things to happen , they 're going to take control , " mueller said at the paris auto salon last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's panamera sedan has helped sales rebound " but that 's not what they want and not why i am here .
i think they chose me for this position because they believe i can be an active element and work with my colleagues to make things happen . "
although mueller insists that porsche will largely call its own shots , automobile expert willi diez says vw will want to have its say .
mueller 's close ties with volkswagen will make it easier for him to integrate porsche into the group of vw brands .
" i think it 's certainly understandable that vw wants to strengthen its influence at porsche .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .

" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .

" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now .

this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 21.10.2010 astronomers spot farthest-known galaxy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 million years after the big bang , the universe was in its ' re-ionization ' phase using the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile , a european research team has detected light from the most distant galaxy ever seen - dating back to less than 600 million years after the big bang . in a paper published wednesday in the journal nature , a european research team reported that the newfound galaxy udfy-38185539 is the remotest cosmic object ever recorded .
studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "

bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 21.10.2010 astronomers spot farthest-known galaxy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 million years after the big bang , the universe was in its ' re-ionization ' phase using the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- in chile , a european research team has detected light from the most distant galaxy ever seen - dating back to less than 600 million years after the big bang . in a paper published wednesday in the journal nature , a european research team reported that the newfound galaxy udfy-38185539 is the remotest cosmic object ever recorded .
studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.10.2010 analysts like new porsche chief , but vw tie-up could face delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are taking some of the shine off the vw-porsche deal volkswagen 's planned integration of porsche could be delayed due to lawsuits and taxes , vw said this week .
but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .
porsche has tried to take over the much larger vw by securing stock through options trading , but failed in its bid , while watching its debt triple to more than 10 billion euros .
vw then agreed last year to incorporate porsche into its family of brands , which includes audi , seat , skoda and lamborghini .
volkswagen bought half of porsche 's sports-car business late last year for 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- .
vw has said it wants to acquire the rest of porsche in 2011 .
new man at the helm while vw and porsche continue down the rather pothole-marked road toward a union , they are hoping a new man at the head of porsche can avoid any more unforeseen obstacles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias mueller performed well for audi , and is close to vw chief winterkorn matthias mueller , 57 , got behind the wheel at porsche at the beginning of this month , taking over from michael macht , who took a position on the vw management board , where he is now in charge of group production .
mueller , vw 's top car-model strategist , is expected to spread the success he had at vw 's audi unit to porsche .
analysts say he has the know-how to do it , as well as the support .
mueller is considered close to vw chief winterkorn and still enjoys strong support at porsche headquarters in stuttgart .
" he fits in here .
i especially like the fact that he 's not all talk .
he gets things done , " said uwe hueck , the head of porsche 's works council .
independence mueller has insisted he is not coming to stuttgart to simply do the bidding of executives in wolfsburg , where vw is based .
while wolfsburg will be involved in discussions , he said porsche will not lose its autonomy .
" if we take an active role in running this company , wolfsburg will basically leave us alone .
but if we are passive and just wait for things to happen , they 're going to take control , " mueller said at the paris auto salon last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's panamera sedan has helped sales rebound " but that 's not what they want and not why i am here .
i think they chose me for this position because they believe i can be an active element and work with my colleagues to make things happen . "
although mueller insists that porsche will largely call its own shots , automobile expert willi diez says vw will want to have its say .
mueller 's close ties with volkswagen will make it easier for him to integrate porsche into the group of vw brands .
" i think it 's certainly understandable that vw wants to strengthen its influence at porsche .
they naturally want to have someone at the top that enjoys the trust of the vw board .
also , that he runs things there in a way that volkswagen thinks is right , " he said .
a ' good move ' mueller 's resume , which includes his time as the head of audi 's product management and new model development , makes him well suited for the top job at porsche , according to juergen pieper , an automotive expert at the metzler bank .
" i think this is a good move for porsche , " he said .
" i do n't know mr. mueller personally , but i have heard from reliable sources that he is a very strong motivator , knows his cars and that he 's made a lot of positive things happen , such as at audi where his years there were very good ones .
volkswagen aims to surpass auto giant toyota in deliveries and profitability by 2018 .
its integration of porsche is part of that plan .
porsche , for its part , wants to expand its own line-up to double annual sales in the mid-term to 150,000 cars and sports utility vehicles .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

germany 's other teams , borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen , came away with draws in the group stage . at home in the bundesliga , vfb stuttgart could n't look any worse than their position in last place in the table .
but in the group stage of the europa league , stuttgart is emerging as one of the top teams , winning 1-0 against spanish side getafe cf thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller started off on the right foot internationally it was the international coaching debut of stuttgart 's new coach jens keller , who replaced the recently fired christian gross .
keller could n't have asked for a better start as stuttgart recorded their third straight europa league win .
stuttgart 's goal came in the 29th minute from romanian striker ciprian marica .
fielding a pass from cacau , a sprinting marica was all alone and put a shot past getafe 's keeper oscar ustari .
after the game , head coach keller said he was more than satisfied and hoped his team 's momentum would carry over into the bundesliga .
" we reached our stated goal , " keller said after the game .
" we 'll take a little bit of confidence with us for our game on sunday -lsb- against st. pauli -rsb- . "
the win puts stuttgart on top of their group with a spotless nine points , while getafe remains in third with three .
draws for dortmund , leverkusen while stuttgart seems to send a different team onto the pitch for the europa league than the one that is lounging in the basement of the bundesliga , borussia dortmund 's dominance in the german league has n't quite been reflected internationally .
thursday 's 1-1 draw at home against paris st. germain was by no means a bad result , but their position in their group could have been much better had they not conceded a late goal that spoiled a win .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal was equalized near the end of the game five minutes after half time , dortmund was awarded a penalty kick when psg 's mamadou sakho fouled jakub blaszczykowski in the penalty area .
nuri sahin converted the penalty to give dortmund the lead , which looked like it would be enough for a victory .
but in the 87th minute , psg substitute clement chantome saved a point for the french side , scoring easily from five meters .
despite nearly coming away with a win - which would have put dortmund even on points with the group leaders , psg and sevilla - dortmund coach juergen klopp was optimistic about the draw .
" it 's not so bad that we only played to a draw , " klopp said .
" we got a point and saw that we can beat this team on the road . "
rounding out thursday 's europa league results , bayer leverkusen drew 0-0 on the road against greek side aris saloniki .
leading their group with five points , leverkusen are now one point ahead of saloniki and atletico madrid and two points ahead of rosenborg bk .

germany 's other teams , borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen , came away with draws in the group stage . at home in the bundesliga , vfb stuttgart could n't look any worse than their position in last place in the table .
but in the group stage of the europa league , stuttgart is emerging as one of the top teams , winning 1-0 against spanish side getafe cf thursday night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller started off on the right foot internationally it was the international coaching debut of stuttgart 's new coach jens keller , who replaced the recently fired christian gross .
keller could n't have asked for a better start as stuttgart recorded their third straight europa league win .
stuttgart 's goal came in the 29th minute from romanian striker ciprian marica .
fielding a pass from cacau , a sprinting marica was all alone and put a shot past getafe 's keeper oscar ustari .
after the game , head coach keller said he was more than satisfied and hoped his team 's momentum would carry over into the bundesliga .
" we reached our stated goal , " keller said after the game .
" we 'll take a little bit of confidence with us for our game on sunday -lsb- against st. pauli -rsb- . "
the win puts stuttgart on top of their group with a spotless nine points , while getafe remains in third with three .

despite nearly coming away with a win - which would have put dortmund even on points with the group leaders , psg and sevilla - dortmund coach juergen klopp was optimistic about the draw .
" it 's not so bad that we only played to a draw , " klopp said .
" we got a point and saw that we can beat this team on the road . "
rounding out thursday 's europa league results , bayer leverkusen drew 0-0 on the road against greek side aris saloniki .

chief minister nitish kumar is likely to succeed in his bid to win another term in office for the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- . millions voted peacefully thursday at the start of the six-phase assembly poll in bihar where chief minister nitish kumar is facing a tough challenge from a splintered opposition .
there were reports of some early incidents including minor fights between rival groups .
electronic voting machines malfunctioned in a few polling booths while in another area an election official was beaten up .
but for a state notorious for poll related violence , it was a quiet start .
improving conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar nitish kumar , a former engineer , won the election five years ago after promising better infrastructure and development .
to an extent , there has been some improvement in the state 's infrastructure with better roads and electricity supplies .
moreover security for normal citizens , which had been very poor earlier , has also improved .
kumar claims credit for the turnaround .
for decades , bihar , which sends 40 of the 545 lawmakers to the national parliament in delhi , has been lagging behind in terms of most social and economic indicators .
as one of india 's poorest and most corrupt states , politics in bihar has often revolved around caste groups .
and political parties have been quick to exploit the situation .
action instead of empty promises interestingly , the main poll issue is development .
all the political parties have been wooing voters by promising more and better development .
there is a simple explanation : the mindset of voters has changed .
they want action , not empty promises .
more development shivnath jha from madhepura who voted thursday said his village would vote for those who ushered in progress .
" i will vote for a political party that promises us development .
our choice is clear , better our lives and you will get our vote .
development is what we need and that is what we will vote for , " he says .
" candidate who will work for us " similar sentiments were expressed by shambu paswan , a villager : " we will vote for a candidate who will work for us .
not for a person who stands on party loyalities and forgets us after the election .
we won ’ t vote for that person . "
kumar is opposed by a coalition headed by the rashtriya janata dal party whose chief is lalu prasad yadav .
his party once ruled bihar for 15 years before being toppled in 2005 .
split with the bjp ?
a confident lalu prasad said his party would sweep to victory at the elections .
" today the first phase of polling is going on and we are going to sweep the whole of bihar .
nobody can save nitish kumar ’ s government because he has failed on all fronts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bjp leaders anant kumar -lrb- l . -rrb- , arun jaitley and ravi shankar prasad hoping that his work would speak for itself in the past 5 years , kumar spurned an offer from his ally , the bjp , to allow their star campaigner narender modi , the chief minister of gujarat , to campaign for the ruling coalition .
this has sparked rumours of a possible split with the bjp in the event his party wins with a comfortable majority .
kumar has not forgotten that modi was allegedly responsible for the sectarian riots in his state in 2002 that claimed over 1,000 lives .
the main political parties have promised to campaign even harder in the next five rounds of voting .
votes will be counted on november 24 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 21.10.2010 brussels seeks regulation to protect public purse from failing banks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier wants to shield taxpayers from a repeat of 2008 the european commission is keen to introduce a new system to guard against a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis .
under the plans , regulators would be given new powers and encouraged to tackle cross-border issues . taxpayers should no longer be responsible for bailing out banks , the european union 's top official for market regulation said on wednesday , vowing to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis .
" i am absolutely determined to do everything in our power ... to spare taxpayers from paying for the banks , " eu internal market commissioner michel barnier said , adding , " it is the banks that should pay themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish taxpayers must grudgingly foot a 45-billion-euro bill " never again should we leave governments and taxpayers with the unacceptable choice ... between a catastrophe or a state-funded rescue , " barnier insisted .
greater supervision the european commission says greater supervision of the banks is the only way to stop a meltdown .
barnier wants to force financial institutions to draw up contingency plans for crisis situations and to give regulators the power to fire the management if there are clear signs a bank is running into trouble .
barnier 's stated aim is prevention - a notion that is popular in countries like ireland , according to arthur beasley of the irish times .
irish taxpayers are currently looking at a 45-billion euro -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- banking sector bill .
" i think that anything that would increase regulation - if it proved effective - would indeed be welcome , because what we saw in ireland was regulatory failure heaped upon political failure , heaped upon massive , excessive lending in the banking system , " beasley said .
a pan-european ' college ' but it 's not just national banks that are the problem .
many european banks operate across europe , and yet there is no established pan-european system .
barnier has proposed such a system to clean up the difficulties incurred by banks crossing borders ; the commissioner wants national regulators to pool together in what he calls a " college " so that they can manage cross-border banking crises .

under the plans , regulators would be given new powers and encouraged to tackle cross-border issues . taxpayers should no longer be responsible for bailing out banks , the european union 's top official for market regulation said on wednesday , vowing to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis .
" i am absolutely determined to do everything in our power ... to spare taxpayers from paying for the banks , " eu internal market commissioner michel barnier said , adding , " it is the banks that should pay themselves . "

barnier wants to force financial institutions to draw up contingency plans for crisis situations and to give regulators the power to fire the management if there are clear signs a bank is running into trouble .

chief minister nitish kumar is likely to succeed in his bid to win another term in office for the national democratic alliance -lrb- nda -rrb- . millions voted peacefully thursday at the start of the six-phase assembly poll in bihar where chief minister nitish kumar is facing a tough challenge from a splintered opposition .
there were reports of some early incidents including minor fights between rival groups .
electronic voting machines malfunctioned in a few polling booths while in another area an election official was beaten up .
but for a state notorious for poll related violence , it was a quiet start .
improving conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar nitish kumar , a former engineer , won the election five years ago after promising better infrastructure and development .
to an extent , there has been some improvement in the state 's infrastructure with better roads and electricity supplies .
moreover security for normal citizens , which had been very poor earlier , has also improved .
kumar claims credit for the turnaround .
for decades , bihar , which sends 40 of the 545 lawmakers to the national parliament in delhi , has been lagging behind in terms of most social and economic indicators .
as one of india 's poorest and most corrupt states , politics in bihar has often revolved around caste groups .
and political parties have been quick to exploit the situation .
action instead of empty promises interestingly , the main poll issue is development .
all the political parties have been wooing voters by promising more and better development .
there is a simple explanation : the mindset of voters has changed .
they want action , not empty promises .
more development shivnath jha from madhepura who voted thursday said his village would vote for those who ushered in progress .
" i will vote for a political party that promises us development .
our choice is clear , better our lives and you will get our vote .
development is what we need and that is what we will vote for , " he says .
" candidate who will work for us " similar sentiments were expressed by shambu paswan , a villager : " we will vote for a candidate who will work for us .
not for a person who stands on party loyalities and forgets us after the election .
we won ’ t vote for that person . "
kumar is opposed by a coalition headed by the rashtriya janata dal party whose chief is lalu prasad yadav .
his party once ruled bihar for 15 years before being toppled in 2005 .
split with the bjp ?
a confident lalu prasad said his party would sweep to victory at the elections .
" today the first phase of polling is going on and we are going to sweep the whole of bihar .
nobody can save nitish kumar ’ s government because he has failed on all fronts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bjp leaders anant kumar -lrb- l . -rrb- , arun jaitley and ravi shankar prasad hoping that his work would speak for itself in the past 5 years , kumar spurned an offer from his ally , the bjp , to allow their star campaigner narender modi , the chief minister of gujarat , to campaign for the ruling coalition .
this has sparked rumours of a possible split with the bjp in the event his party wins with a comfortable majority .
kumar has not forgotten that modi was allegedly responsible for the sectarian riots in his state in 2002 that claimed over 1,000 lives .
the main political parties have promised to campaign even harder in the next five rounds of voting .
votes will be counted on november 24 .

she was 91 . hannelore schmidt , nicknamed loki , died early on thursday at her home in the northen city of hamburg , her husband 's parliamentary office said .
her health had deteriorated since she broke a foot after a heavy fall at home .
loki schmidt was beloved by germans for her down-to-earth nature and devotion to her husband of nearly seven decades .
she and helmut schmidt met as schoolchildren and married in 1942 .
her husband was west germany 's chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , leading the country through cold war tensions and a bloody wave of terror by far-left radicals , the red army faction .
loki was more at home on nature trails than on the red carpet .
the renowned biologist with the characteristic short haircut was a passionate botanist who urged environmental awareness years before the term " green " became a buzzword . she started a foundation for the protection of endangered plants and beginning in 1980 , she selected germany 's " flower of the year . "
both loki and her husband were known as passionate smokers and made headlines in 2008 for lighting up in a hamburg theater that had banned smoking .
last year , loki schmidt published her memoirs , entitled " tell me how things used to be . "
she is survived by her husband and a daughter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 21.10.2010 waiting for the final result großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press conference of afghanistan 's independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- .
nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

these famous first- and second-generation immigrants are showing germany and its newcomers what you can be achieve if you speak the language well . a boxer , a rapper , a government minister .
they 're all sticking their tongues out at you , the reader .
even more surprising , their tongues are colored black , red and gold , just like the german flag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

the aim is to curb fraud , but food producers are fuming . the german government announced on wednesday the launch of a new website to allow citizens to report food fraud .
the site should be up and running by march , 2011 , according to consumer affairs minister ilse aigner , who said the project was intended to " promote a discourse between the public and the food industry that is long overdue . "
" what 's in a product must be identified on the label , " the minister told reporters in berlin on wednesday , citing a number of examples in which foodstuffs were " fraudulently labeled . "
" a yogurt purporting to contain real fruit , mus n't solely be made of artificial fruit flavoring , " aigner said . " we want to know if people consider this to be a fraud , and if they want us to act against the producer . "
dubious technologies the announcement comes after a series of public revelations about modern technologies used in the growing convenience food market .
aigner demanded more transparency in the food industry , saying producers should call a spade a spade .
the consumer affairs minister said germans should be aware , for example , that the " cheese " on packaged pizzas is often so-called analogue cheese - a mixture of soybeans , nutritional yeasts and other non-dairy ingredients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheese on this pizza may or may not be real even grocery-store versions of the cherished german dish schnitzel were cast in ugly doubt as it became known that some companies produce them from snippets of calf meat held together by an organic glue .

foodwatch germany considers the government website " to be of essential importance " in its efforts " to make food production more transparent . "
" the government has finally acknowledged that consumers here are being grossly cheated in supermarkets , " said matthias wolfschmidt , a spokesman for the non-profit organisation .
the advocacy groups also hope the decision will rein in labeling fraud in the organic food sector , where sharply rising imports have recently cast doubts on whether the higher-priced foods are really produced in an environmentally friendly manner .
industrial worries germany 's food industry , meanwhile , has come out against the new internet portal , which they have deemed an " unlawful act , which will pillory producers without scientific proof . "
industry representatives say there are already more than enough authorities officially charged with maintaining food security and that any alleged violations " must be sorted out in the courts . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.10.2010 analysts like new porsche chief , but vw tie-up could face delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are taking some of the shine off the vw-porsche deal volkswagen 's planned integration of porsche could be delayed due to lawsuits and taxes , vw said this week .
but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .
porsche has tried to take over the much larger vw by securing stock through options trading , but failed in its bid , while watching its debt triple to more than 10 billion euros .
vw then agreed last year to incorporate porsche into its family of brands , which includes audi , seat , skoda and lamborghini .
volkswagen bought half of porsche 's sports-car business late last year for 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- .
vw has said it wants to acquire the rest of porsche in 2011 .
new man at the helm while vw and porsche continue down the rather pothole-marked road toward a union , they are hoping a new man at the head of porsche can avoid any more unforeseen obstacles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias mueller performed well for audi , and is close to vw chief winterkorn matthias mueller , 57 , got behind the wheel at porsche at the beginning of this month , taking over from michael macht , who took a position on the vw management board , where he is now in charge of group production .
mueller , vw 's top car-model strategist , is expected to spread the success he had at vw 's audi unit to porsche .
analysts say he has the know-how to do it , as well as the support .
mueller is considered close to vw chief winterkorn and still enjoys strong support at porsche headquarters in stuttgart .
" he fits in here .
i especially like the fact that he 's not all talk .
he gets things done , " said uwe hueck , the head of porsche 's works council .
independence mueller has insisted he is not coming to stuttgart to simply do the bidding of executives in wolfsburg , where vw is based .
while wolfsburg will be involved in discussions , he said porsche will not lose its autonomy .
" if we take an active role in running this company , wolfsburg will basically leave us alone .
but if we are passive and just wait for things to happen , they 're going to take control , " mueller said at the paris auto salon last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's panamera sedan has helped sales rebound " but that 's not what they want and not why i am here .
i think they chose me for this position because they believe i can be an active element and work with my colleagues to make things happen . "
although mueller insists that porsche will largely call its own shots , automobile expert willi diez says vw will want to have its say .
mueller 's close ties with volkswagen will make it easier for him to integrate porsche into the group of vw brands .
" i think it 's certainly understandable that vw wants to strengthen its influence at porsche .
they naturally want to have someone at the top that enjoys the trust of the vw board .
also , that he runs things there in a way that volkswagen thinks is right , " he said .
a ' good move ' mueller 's resume , which includes his time as the head of audi 's product management and new model development , makes him well suited for the top job at porsche , according to juergen pieper , an automotive expert at the metzler bank .
" i think this is a good move for porsche , " he said .
" i do n't know mr. mueller personally , but i have heard from reliable sources that he is a very strong motivator , knows his cars and that he 's made a lot of positive things happen , such as at audi where his years there were very good ones .
volkswagen aims to surpass auto giant toyota in deliveries and profitability by 2018 .
its integration of porsche is part of that plan .
porsche , for its part , wants to expand its own line-up to double annual sales in the mid-term to 150,000 cars and sports utility vehicles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 21.10.2010 more than 244,000 opt out of google street view in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of next year , street view will be availabe for german cities a quarter of a million germans have objected to having their homes put on display in google street view .
the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 21.10.2010 eu awards cuban dissident guillermo farinas top human rights prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas says the situation in cuba is getting better the european parliament has awarded its prestigious sakharov prize to cuban dissident guillermo farinas .
earlier this year , farinas had gone on a hunger strike to press for the release of imprisoned opposition figures . the european parliament awarded the prestigious sakharov human rights prize to cuban dissident guillermo farinas on wednesday .
the parliament praised farinas as a " symbol of the fight for freedom of speech " and democracy .
farinas received news of the award at his home in the central cuban city of santa clara . " the civilized world , the european parliament , is sending a message to the cuban governing class that it 's time for democracy and freedom of thought and expression in cuba : an end to the dictatorship , " farinas said . farinas added that the award was not for him , " but rather for the cuban people , who for the past 50 years have been struggling to get out of this dictatorship . " a peaceful protester farinas is one of cuba 's most prominent human rights activists .
in july , the 48-year-old psychologist ended a hunger strike after cuba released a large group of dissidents imprisoned for their criticism of the regime .
they had been among 75 opposition figures arrested in the cuban " black spring " in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : during his 2010 hunger strike , farinas had to be drip-fed so he would n't starve farinas , who is the third cuban to recieve the award , spent most of this time on hunger strike in a hospital where he was drip-fed to avoid starvation .
" i think the situation in cuba has changed , " he said after the strike .
" and this is first and foremost because of the pro-democracy movement in cuba that has fought for the freedom of political prisoners . "
eleven years in prison farinas has taken part in as many as 23 hunger strikes , directed first against former cuban leader fidel castro and now against castro 's brother , raul , who has since replaced him as leader of the nation .
yet farinas started out as a supporter of the cuban revolution .
his father fought alongside marxist revolutionary che guevara during the 1965 congo crisis .
but farinas soon distanced himself from the cuban leadership .
in the late 1980s he left the communist youth organization and moved towards the opposition .
since then he has suffered through numerous trials and accusations .
he has spent a total of 11 years in prison . " i dedicate this prize to cuba , to the people that have suffered so much and are still suffering , " farinas said ahead of the announcement .
" i dedicate it to all cubans who have died because they fought for democracy - and to all those who have supported me in my hunger strikes and to those who have not given up in the face of massive propaganda against me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buzek praised farinas for risking his own life in protest the prize , which is named after the late soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded to world figures such as nelson mandela , burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi and former united nations secretary-general kofi annan .
it is endowed with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,100 -rrb- .
european parliament president jerzy buzek praised farinas , saying the activist was " ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in cuba . " the eu lifted its diplomatic sanctions against cuba in 2008 but still ties its economic cooperation with the country to the plight of its political prisoners .

" the civilized world , the european parliament , is sending a message to the cuban governing class that it 's time for democracy and freedom of thought and expression in cuba : an end to the dictatorship , " farinas said . farinas added that the award was not for him , " but rather for the cuban people , who for the past 50 years have been struggling to get out of this dictatorship . " a peaceful protester farinas is one of cuba 's most prominent human rights activists .
in july , the 48-year-old psychologist ended a hunger strike after cuba released a large group of dissidents imprisoned for their criticism of the regime .
they had been among 75 opposition figures arrested in the cuban " black spring " in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : during his 2010 hunger strike , farinas had to be drip-fed so he would n't starve farinas , who is the third cuban to recieve the award , spent most of this time on hunger strike in a hospital where he was drip-fed to avoid starvation .
" i think the situation in cuba has changed , " he said after the strike .
" and this is first and foremost because of the pro-democracy movement in cuba that has fought for the freedom of political prisoners . "
eleven years in prison farinas has taken part in as many as 23 hunger strikes , directed first against former cuban leader fidel castro and now against castro 's brother , raul , who has since replaced him as leader of the nation .
yet farinas started out as a supporter of the cuban revolution .
his father fought alongside marxist revolutionary che guevara during the 1965 congo crisis .
but farinas soon distanced himself from the cuban leadership .
in the late 1980s he left the communist youth organization and moved towards the opposition .
since then he has suffered through numerous trials and accusations .
he has spent a total of 11 years in prison . " i dedicate this prize to cuba , to the people that have suffered so much and are still suffering , " farinas said ahead of the announcement .
" i dedicate it to all cubans who have died because they fought for democracy - and to all those who have supported me in my hunger strikes and to those who have not given up in the face of massive propaganda against me . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buzek praised farinas for risking his own life in protest the prize , which is named after the late soviet dissident andrei sakharov , has been awarded to world figures such as nelson mandela , burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi and former united nations secretary-general kofi annan .
it is endowed with 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,100 -rrb- .
european parliament president jerzy buzek praised farinas , saying the activist was " ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in cuba . " the eu lifted its diplomatic sanctions against cuba in 2008 but still ties its economic cooperation with the country to the plight of its political prisoners .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

the german constitution declares that there shall be no state church , but the government gives the main churches money and clerics give sermons on public television .
time to put a stop to that , says a new lobby group . the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , and her secretary of state , julia kloeckner , both christian democrats , had a crucifix put up wednesday in the conference center of their ministry .
clerics of the two main churches were there to bless the cross .
kloeckner said , " it is good to be supported by the hand of god , and one can show that through making a clear statement . "
oliver loesch , deputy chairman of the youth movement of the opposition social democrats and spokesman of a new social democratic group campaigning for laicism , finds that quite inappropriate .
" ms aigner and ms kloeckner can say that for themselves personally , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have freedom of religion and they can believe what they want , but it 's not the way a ministry should act in germany , because we have the separation of church and state in germany - or we should have . "
too many privileges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it has the task of upholding the values of society he argues that the church still has too many privileges .
the german constitution says , quite clearly , " there shall be no state church . "
but still the churches have protected slots on public television where they can give sermons , bishops ' salaries are paid for by the state , the state finances the faculties of theology where priests are trained , and there are crucifixes , not only in the consumer affairs ministry , but also in courtrooms and classrooms .
" our highest court decided already in 1995 that this should not be , " said loesch , " that if a teacher or a parent objected , the cross should be taken down .
so we have this law , but this law is not applied . "
representatives of the church see the matter differently .
alois glueck , president of the central committee of german catholics , says that germany is a christian country .
" of course our entire value system is linked to christianity , " he said in a radio interview .
" that 's also what has put its stamp on our culture and our values .
the values of our constitution are essentially christian values .
nowadays the churches are once more expected to make a contribution to the development of a sense of values in our society .
but that does n't mean the state is propagating religion . "
islam is a new factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church now has to live with a growing muslim community the debate about the role of the church in society comes just as questions are being asked about the role of islam here .
in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 , president christian wulff said that islam now belongs to germany as christianity and judaism do . and last thursday , the education minister , annette schavan , announced that the state would help finance the training of muslim clerics and religion teachers at german universities .
oliver loesch does n't see that as the way to show the equality of islam .
" of course there are two ways to ensure that muslims get the same treatment as all religious and non-religious groups in germany , " he said .
" the one is that the muslim groups should get the same financial aid and assistance to get into the educational system ; but you can also say that none of these religious groups should have these possibilities , and that 's the way we are thinking . "
but mouhanad khorchide , a professor of islamic education at the university of muenster , which is one of the beneficiaries of the government 's new islamic theology program , also points to the german constitution , which says that the state must ensure that schools offer religious instruction given by the religious communities themselves .
that 's a right he wants for muslims too , but he agrees with glueck : germany is strongly influenced by christianity , so he does n't mind crucifixes in schools .
" but the current discussion shows that germany - and europe - have not just remained christian , they 've become multi-religious , " he argues , " so the question is : should n't room be found for other symbols , and not just the cross ? "
what is secularism ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french schoolgirls may not wear headscarves in school ; is that secularism ?
in fact , he thinks the social democratic laity have got it wrong . secularism does not necessarily mean getting rid of every public sign of religion .
" we have to ask ourselves what we understand by secularism , " he told deutsche welle .
" perhaps we should revise our view so that it means the institutional separation between religion and state , leaving space for the religious symbols which provide people with an identity , without worrying that the state will thereby lose its secular status . "
with the arrival of islam on the scene , the question of how far religion should have an influence on public life has been given a new dimension .
the constitution may have been influenced by christianity , but it was also influenced by a secular tradition of republican values which , as several writers have pointed out , often had to fight the churches for such achievements as the rights of women or freedom of religious practice for non-christians .
the social democrat lobby group has applied for official recognition by the party .
so far it 's met with opposition , with the party chairman , sigmar gabriel , saying that the chances of approval were slim .
commentators have noted that the adoption of a line critical of the church could cost the party votes in important elections in the traditionalist state of baden-wuerttemberg next march .

the service plans to launch by the end of the year and has sparked a heated debate about privacy issues in germany . in a company blog entry posted in english and german on thursday , google said that more than 244,000 residents in germany have requested that images of their homes be removed from google 's street view mapping service .
that figure is out of a total of nearly 8.5 million households in germany 's 20 largest cities where the service will first launch .
" so what we came up with is that less than three percent of the households opt-out of street view , " said lena wagner , a google spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
wagner also said that this shows that maybe germans are n't as opposed to street view as maybe the rhetoric suggests .
major political figures , including the consumer affairs minister , ilse aigner , as well as data protection officials , have come out strongly against google .
one recent survey just a few months ago in germany found that over 50 percent of those polled were opposed to having their homes shown on street view .
some local residents have even put up anti-google signs in their yard .
but wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has been a strong critic of google experts surprised at high figure some internet policy experts say that because you have to opt-out of google street view , which means that residents have to explicitly say that they do n't want to be part of it , it 's surprising that the number of objectors was even that high .
" going to a website , and entering all this information it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort , and i am just staggered by this 200,000 plus -lsb- number -rsb- , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , a professor of internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
he added that data protection and privacy studies have shown that most people are lazy and do n't bother to go through with filling out the forms necessary to opt-out .
mayer-schoenberger cited a a 2003 study from duke university in the united states that concluded that " less than 10 percent of the u.s. population ever opts out of a mailing list - often the figure is less than three percent . "
that may explain the difference between the widespread visceral reaction that some germans had against street view and the fact that relatively few people did anything about it .
the controversy surrounding google street view is one of the first privacy issues that has reached such a level of national debate in germany .
in recent months , google even took out advertisements in major magazines and newspapers in order to explain to the public what google street view is .
but unlike other data privacy questions , which are often limited to a narrow group of privacy activists and online geeks , this time the question revolved around a private company having access to images of people 's homes .
" a house is not a usual thing , " explained thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law . " it 's not only a house .
it 's a secret , private place and we 've had very bad experiences , when we had the nazis , which were controlling all the houses into blocks and things like that .
i think that 's one of the reasons why germans are so shocked if somebody wants to show the house , now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view allows users to get a panoramic view of streets and houses long history of privacy protection however , since the time of the nazis and the stasi secret police in east germany , the country has had one of the toughest privacy laws in the world .
this opt-out plan may be fundamentally at odds with one of the basic tenants of german privacy law , that citizens must opt-in to have their data collected in any way .
after all , germany has n't had a census in over 20 years because of privacy concerns .
" it 's unclear to me whether and to what extent this violates the german federal data protection act , " added mayer-schoenberger " and there might be some legal action in the wings . " still , google 's lena wagner added that the company is only weeks away from launching google street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities , including berlin , hamburg and munich .
google certainly will eventually expand the service to the rest of germany : over the last two years , it already has taken street view photographs of nearly every city and village in the entire country .

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government released figures on thursday sharply raising its figures from a previous forecast and predicting a drop in unemployment . the german economics ministry has more than doubled its growth forecast for the german economy .
in his autumn review , economics minister rainer bruederle said on thursday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 3.4 percent , up from a forecast of 1.4 percent in the spring .
" we have seen growth rates like this only once since the reunification boom , " bruederle said , referring to a 2006 economic leap .
from problem child to model student " the new figures make germany the growth motor of europe , " bruederle added .
" germany is the land of economic recovery . "
bruederle added that it was time for berlin to start wrapping up stimulus and bank bailout programs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany was europe 's motor for economic recovery berlin expects unemployment to continue to fall , dropping by 190,000 to 3.2 million this year and falling below the key three-million mark to 2.9 million in 2011 . " the german employment market has changed from being the problem child to becoming a model student , " bruederle said .
comback for the world 's second-biggest exporter just last year , germany was hit by its steepest downturn in about six decades when the economy contracted by 4.7 per cent . but now exports are booming and companies are reporting solid profits .
the government cautions , however , that the economic expansion rate will slow to 1.8 per cent in 2011 as the global economy loses steam . even this predicted drop must be put into perspective , according to friedrich heinemann of the mannheim-based center for european economic research . " germany has an aging economy and an aging population , " heinemann told deutsche welle . " we do not have the growth potential of some of the emerging economies , so 1.8 percent is not that bad , and it would really be a success if we could have this speed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains the world 's second-biggest exporter , after china . germany needs domestic demand as the world 's second biggest exporter after china , germany 's economy is largely dependent on global growth .
but heinemann said germany can not afford to rely solely on exports : " the hope really is that domestic demand , not only private consumers but also domestic firms , start to invest again ...
so both aspects , domestic and external demand , could really match each other next year . " the government 's growth projections are in line with recent forecasts by the nation 's leading economic institutes .
the european commission has also forecasted a 3.4-percent growth rate for germany this year . author : dagmar breitenbach , andreas illmer , -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayguel oezkan is a minister in the lower saxony government the integration debate continues in germany , but there 's one group that 's taking a more positive spin .
the german foundation for integration has kicked off the second round of an advertising campaign to get immigrants to learn german .
the ads feature famous first- or second- generation immigrants sticking out their german flag-colored tongues .
there 's a soccer star , rappers , boxers and the first muslim female state government cabinet minister .
the slogan reads , " raus mit der sprache , rein ins leben , " which roughly translates to " speak the language , live the life . "
a message of opportunity " our message is quite clear , " ferry pausch , director of the foundation told deutsche welle .
" if you speak german , and you speak it well , then all possibilities are open to you . "
pausch said the celebrities in the advertising campaign were success stories that can serve as role models to young people living in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer says the ads show other immigrants what 's possible if they speak german well maria boehmer , germany 's integration commissioner , agrees .
" if you do n't speak german fluently you can only be an onlooker in this country , " she told reporters at a press conference for the ad campaign in berlin on wednesday .
" other people , who have learned german well , have seen that you can get somewhere , get ahead professionally , have a career and be a role model for others . "
" that 's why we wanted to call on people to learn german so they can belong to this country and can take advantage of all the opportunities this country has to offer . "
the foundation was established in 2008 by the association of german magazine publishers and newspapers and magazines place the ads for free .
the daily bild zeitung , the newspaper with the highest circulation in germany , and hurriyet , one of the most popular turkish-language newspapers in germany , have already agreed to run the ads .
the slogan has been translated into turkish , polish and italian and an accompanying website helps immigrants find a german language school in the town where they live .
and a message of success but the ads are n't just targeted at those with immigrant backgrounds , according to pausch .
the foundation also hopes to send a message to the general population .
they want people to know that " it does n't matter how someone looks , that these are all fellow citizens , " he said , " that they 're not foreigners , this is nothing special , this is everyday stuff , these are all fellow citizens that have the same right as everyone else to speak german fantastically well . "
pausch said good comments and bad comments had come out of the integration debate in germany , but that their comment was about focusing on the positive .
" this is less about pointing a finger and much more about highlighting opportunities , " he said .
perhaps the german language could also use some promotion .
according to katja cantone , a linguist and a professor of german as a second language at the university of duisberg-essen , it could .
" it does not have a bad reputation , " she said , " but too many people believe they have to decide between their first language and germany .
but this is not true . "
achieving their goals with german how good is good enough ?
turkish president abdullah gul told one newspaper that turkish people living in germany needed to learn to speak german without an accent , while german chancellor angela merkel told a group of young conservatives that those who did not learn german immediately upon arrival were not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pausch says he hopes to have more athletes like jerome boateng in the next round of ads cantone has little patience for these kind of remarks .
" as a linguist , i can not accept certain conditions made by politicians who do not know anything about language acquisition , " she said .
not all of the celebrities in the campaign speak perfect , accent-free german , pausch said .
" but all of them have learned german well enough so that they could achieve their goals . "
there can be barriers for immigrants wanting to learn german , said boris zaffarana , spokesman from the german association of adult education centers .
he said most immigrants learning german come to one of these centers , called a volkshochschule in german .
" of course , often people do n't sign up for a german course , for family reasons , for a variety of reasons , " he said .
" but many eventually do find their way to the volkshochschule and then they learn german . "

somehow experience and more than a little good fortune won out for the german sides . the champions league is a different ball game for different teams .
for those struggling in the domestic campaign , it can either offer the chance to get a much-needed fillip in a different environment , or else it 's an unwelcome distraction for teams determined to shore up their ailing sides .
attitude is everything .
when sides are below par at home , their approach to their european duties is a good measure of their ambition .
all three german teams in this season 's champion league are struggling in the bundesliga .
the best-placed of them , bayern munich , is currently in 10th spot in the table - with 11 points from eight games - basically an unendurable humiliation for germany 's mega-club .
a place below them languish werder bremen - with the same points to games ratio , but leaking goals at an alarming rate .
only one team - borussia moenchengladbach in 15th - can offer a more pathetic defensive record .
but werder 's domestic troubles are envied by germany 's other representative in the europe 's major competition - schalke 04 .
with eight games gone , and big name signings like raul failing to spark , schalke are looking up at their rivals from the relegation zone , five defeats and one win to their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul showed he still had it against hapoel tel aviv different attitudes but the differing performances of the three stricken ' giants ' of german football in the latest round of champions league group games are telling .
while all three can at least point to consistent appearances in europe 's top competition in the last few years , only one team showed enough sense of entitlement to defy current form .
bayern were unconvincing , to say the least , in tuesday 's 3-2 victory over their romanian guests cfr cluj .
cluj scored the first three goals of the game - the only trouble being that two of them were at their own end , and bayern limped to the interval with a 2-1 advantage .
they re-grouped in the second half , and managed to extend the fortuitous lead through mario gomez , who - if media hype is to be believed - has apparently turned his entire career around with two good performances and four goals in two games .
but while the romanians piled on the pressure in the last few minutes - scoring one more to set up a precarious finish - it was bayern who came out on top .
of course .
that 's three wins out of three and a place in the knock-out stage virtually assured .
thank you very much .
champions league veteran turns it on for schalke schalke 's 3-1 victory over israeli champions hapoel tel aviv , on the other hand , can only be described adequately with that beautiful german expression , the befreiungsschlag - literally , the ' liberating blow . '
with the pressure mounting after their miserable bundesliga form , it was already obvious before the game that the team saw this as a potential confidence-booster .
though manager felix magath was careful to respect hapoel 's nothing-left-to-lose threat , his players focussed on how this match could influence domestic form .
" this is a different competition where we 're in a good position after the win against -lrb- benfica -rrb- lisbon , " said goalkeeper manuel neuer .
" we have to build on that and gain confidence for the league . "
christoph metzelder made the priorities even clearer .
" at the moment , it 's all about freeing ourselves in the bundesliga , and nothing else , " the newly-signed defender said in a pre-match interview .
" that is more important than the champions league . "
magath 's comments after the comfortable victory - in which hapoel played neatly but never threatened the germans - were a mixture of elation , relief and defensiveness .
" the win gives all who have criticized us a sign that we can play good football .
we did n't only change the players this summer , but also our style of play too , and that 's difficult , " the manager said in the post-match press conference .
and it was the former real madrid star raul - with three winner 's medals , the one man in schalke 's squad who can claim a real sense of entitlement when it comes to international club competitions - who provided the necessary injection of brilliance .
besides giving schalke the win , his accomplished brace lifted him above ac milan 's filippo inzaghi to become the european cup 's top goal-scorer , with 70 .
now schalke will dare to dream that he can add to his solitary goal in the bundesliga .
goalkeeper injury overshadows bremen draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen scrambled a crucial point in the dying minutes against fc twente schalke have a great chance to advance in europe , but werder bremen are staring at the ignominy of finishing at the bottom of their group , after only managing a 1-1 draw away to dutch champions fc twente .
the result leaves them with two points from three games , let down as ever by their defense .
in a group that contains the european champions , inter milan , and the high-flying premier league team tottenham hotspur , you 'd imagine that their european ambitions are limited .
but werder have taken the hard path to the knockout stages before - most notably in 2005-06 , when they lost three of their six matches and scraped past udinese on a goal difference of 0 to finish second in the group .
with this experience no doubt in mind , bremen fought hard for what could be a crucial point in enschede , after losing their goalkeeper tim wiese to a knee injury in the first half , and the players remained bullish after the game .
" we have three games left , two of which are at home , " said captain torsten frings .
" we have to win those , and we 're always good for a point away . "
second-placed tottenham are well-within striking distance , only two points ahead with nine to play for .
assuming werder beat twente at home on nov .
2 , the trip to london on nov .
24 could well be the deciding fixture .
bremen will be hoping that that sliver of extra european experience over first-timers tottenham will be enough to tip the scales in their favor .

studying it further will hopefully give astronomers a look back at the early days of the universe .
a european research team used an advanced telescope located on cerro paranal in chile to spot light from the galaxy , which was emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang occurred more than 13 billion years ago .
" the interesting thing is that the universe at that moment is vastly different than what it is like now , or five or six billion years ago , " said lead author matthew lehnert of the paris observatory in an interview with deutsche welle .
after the big bang , it took about one billion years for the universe to undergo a period of hydrogen re-ionization , which was driven by energetic objects in the cosmos .
until then , a neutral hydrogen fog absorbed a great deal of galactic light – signifying the " dark ages " of the universe .
six-hundred million years ago , when light from udfy-38185539 was filtering through this hydrogen haze , the re-ionization process was not yet complete - meaning the latest observations offer a glimpse into the " epoch " of the universe .
" it gives you insight into how galaxies formed under vastly different conditions , " lehnert added .
bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

bildunterschrift : the galaxy ' udfy-38135539 , ' shown when the universe was less than 600 million years old the european southern observatory granted the team 16 hours of observation time – or two nights – with the very large telescope -lrb- vlt -rrb- , high in the mountains of chile .
lehnert said an expert observer was responsible for collecting the data , which was then imported into an archive and downloaded by the team over a two-month period .
meanwhile , the astronomers suspect that the far-flung udfy-38185539 galaxy is not alone : the team 's report suggests that other undiscovered sources in the surrounding area also had a hand in re-ionizing the universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a camera on the hubble telescope allowed for " deep-field " images deep in the cosmos observing these so-called " deep-field " galaxies at such great distances was made possible by upgrades to the hubble space telescope , which were completed in 2009 .
a new infrared camera yielded data that allowed five research teams to identify potential " candidate " galaxies from the period just after the creation of the universe more than 13 billion years ago .
using this research as a jumping-off point , lehnert 's group sought to confirm the existence of a galaxy located at a " redshift " value corresponding to a timeframe 600 million years after the big bang .
a team led by ross mclure of the institute for astronomy at edinburgh university was among those who initially detected the existence of udfy-38185539 by analyzing the hubble data .
mclure told deutsche welle that the spectral lehnert 's team observed at 8.5 on the redshift confirmed his team 's own estimates of 8.4 - but that questions remained .
" i would n't say that it 's 100 percent convincing on its own , and i think it will take further observation to actually confirm to everybody 's satisfaction that the redshift is actually reliable for this object , " he said .
bildunterschrift : astronomers used the vlt facility to catch a glimpse of the far-flung galaxy above the noise lehnert 's team located the galaxy by detecting the lyman-alpha spectral line , caused by the emission of hydrogen gas – but took pains to ensure that " noise " from the instrument and elements between the galaxy and earth did not contaminate their findings .
mclure said the astronomers appeared to have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities - such as the presence of an emission line caused by oxygen , which would indicate the presence of a younger galaxy .
" the problem is that these objects are incredibly faint , of course , and they 're very much at the limit of what you can detect in a spectrum with the vlt , " he said , and added that the result is often " noisy " data .
yet the team 's paper concludes that the size of the emission line and its spectral width suggested a " source of astrophysical origin " - whereas a " noisy " result would correspond to a smaller line width .
among the sources of potential contamination are night sky lines , which astronomers must remove .
" getting rid of them in the data is not very easy , so you have to be very , very , careful , " said nicole nesvadba of the institute of spatial astrophysics in france , another one of the paper 's authors , in an interview with deutsche welle .
despite the challenges , researchers were pleasantly surprised .
" we never expected to be able to observe this with present-day telescopes , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of telescopes will facilitate future research looking ahead current observations are driving the construction of new generations of telescopes that could allow researchers to detect " dozens or maybe hundreds " of similar galaxies , nesvadba added .
" we 're in a much better position of planning these instruments , " she said .
meanwhile , mark swinbank , another author from durham university in the united kingdom , acknowledged the current constraints of the team 's research , as well as the high burden of proof to authenticate the galaxy 's signature .
" we 're really pushing the limits of technology here , " he told deutsche welle - saying the next step would be to observe the galaxy again using a different telescope , to " unambiguously prove " the result .
his team was working to confirm one of the universe 's most far-flung galaxies , but swinback said some of the impetus behind their research was also rooted in understanding things closer to home .
" the reason we do this is that what we want to do - ultimately - is to know about our own place in the universe , " he said .

nearly a fourth of the casted ballots have been delcared invalid names of the 249 winners of last month 's parliamentary elections in afghanistan have now been declared .
but final results may be weeks away , since fraud accusations are still being investigated . all of this puts the official election commission in a difficult position .
more than a month after the vote the commission is coming under increasing pressure because the number of complaints about alleged irregularities has soared to more than 4600 , far higher than projected .
this in turn has fuelled suspicions that the vote was rigged : " we do not contest that important people have tried to manipulate these elections , " says fasel ahmad mahnawi , head of the independent election commission .
" more than one million votes stand as a proof for this and have been declared invalid . "
all in all afghanistan 's election authorities have cancelled a total of 1.3 million votes , nearly 25 percent of the total .
the scale of the fraud is at a level similar to that of last year 's presidential election , in which president karzai was finally reelected but lost much of his political legitimacy after his government was found to have been involved in efforts to rig the result .
' free and fair ' elections ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election posters in kabul , afghanistan some of winners on the list now published have sat in parliament before .
that will favor president karzai , says asif baktasch , an expert on domestic affairs : " the outcome is a success for the government " , says baktasch .
" a lot of those closely cooperating with the karzai administration will be represented in the coming parliament .
but i do n't think that what we see has much to do with free and fair elections . "
it remains unclear at this point to what extent karzai 's followers will be able to control the newly elected parliament .
in contrast to most other countries in the democratic world , political parties are not part of afghanistan 's election law and political system .
neither is there a tradition for forging political alliances to facilitate stable majorities in parliament .
over the past few years , president karzai has managed to buy the loyalty of a substantial number of parliamentarians through political promises and other favors and in doing so to affect the way mps vote .
neverthless mps did not always shy away from confrontation with karzai , as was the case when it rejected his list of new ministers in his cabinet after the presidential elections .
powerbrokers and warlords " i 'm not surprised at all to see this happening , " says sanjar sohail , editor of hasht soubh newspaper .
" we have constantly seen that different powerbrokers , among them a number of influential warlords , have illegally interfered in the voting process .
what we see now is that they get rewarded for it with a seat in the new parliament . "
for instance , three out of four names on the preliminary list of winners in the kabul province are well known warlords .
their names are treated with contempt by most ordinary afghans .
mohaqeq , qanuni or sayaaf , who are in leading positions today as they were in the past , are said to be responsible for major war crimes , according to international human rights bodies .
but they and former commanders have been given a de facto amnesty by law .
a more conservative parliament ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghans read a letter posted at a mosque by the taliban warning people against voting in the parliamentary elections " the next parliament will be more conservative and more backward orientated , " says sayfuddin sayhun , who teaches political science and economics at kabul university .
" many of those who will now take their seats in parliament do not care much for democracy and democratic values .
the gap between the people and the parliament will widen , and the credibility of democracy as a political concept will suffer further . "
due to the large number of complaints , the announcement of the final results has been repeatedly pushed back .
now it is expected for mid-november at the earliest .
all things considered , the situation one month after the election is ambiguous : on the one hand more and more cases of fraud are surfacing every day ; on the other , the independent election commission has promised a more transparent approach than after the last fraudulent elections .
it could just be that there is not more fraud this time around , but the fraud in the current elections is being more widely reported than in the past .
that would be a glimmer of hope on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 21.10.2010 analysts like new porsche chief , but vw tie-up could face delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays are taking some of the shine off the vw-porsche deal volkswagen 's planned integration of porsche could be delayed due to lawsuits and taxes , vw said this week .
but it is hoped that the new man at the head of porsche can smooth some bumps along the merger road . legal battles with hedge funds in the united states and germany as well as a possible billion-euro tax bill in germany could delay a merger between luxury sports-car maker porsche and europe 's biggest auto concern , volkswagen , by up to the three years , wolfsburg-based vw announced this week .
the ceo of both volkswagen and porsche holding , martin winterkorn , said that the planned merger for next year must first resolve legal questions around porsche 's failed takeover bid for vw and a resolution of discussions with german tax authorities over a multi-billion-euro tax that could be levied on the merger .
porsche is being sued by 35 hedge funds in the us , who claim they took a financial hit due to market manipulation by porsche when the company tried , and failed , to take over vw .
the plaintiffs , us based short-sellers of vw stock , claim the sports-car maker 's secret cornering of the market in vw shares caused them to lose more then $ 1 billion .
several german investors have also threatened to sue , but have not done so yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw chief winterkorn says he will integrate porsche into his company sooner or later volkswagen has said that a us supreme court ruling this year limited foreign investors ' ability to sue companies based abroad in american courts , which will help it fight the pending lawsuits .
" we consider the us complaints to be ineligible and unfounded , " said winterkorn , who continues to insist that porsche will eventually become part of the vw family of brands .
" let me be quite clear about this : the integrated automotive group will happen . "
the earliest the case could be dismissed is january , or it might take years to be settled .
tax question vw is also waiting for a decision by german tax officials on the tax-exempt status of profits from porsche 's options transactions .
currently , legal requirements around porsche 's structure would result in higher levels of taxation if vw and the stuttgart-based company were to merge before the end of 2014 .
if the companies delay the tie-up until early 2015 , it would be tax free .
this new development is but the latest scene in a porsche-vw merger drama that has dragged on for years , with more than its share of twists , turns and reversals of fortune .
porsche has tried to take over the much larger vw by securing stock through options trading , but failed in its bid , while watching its debt triple to more than 10 billion euros .
vw then agreed last year to incorporate porsche into its family of brands , which includes audi , seat , skoda and lamborghini .
volkswagen bought half of porsche 's sports-car business late last year for 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- .
vw has said it wants to acquire the rest of porsche in 2011 .
new man at the helm while vw and porsche continue down the rather pothole-marked road toward a union , they are hoping a new man at the head of porsche can avoid any more unforeseen obstacles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias mueller performed well for audi , and is close to vw chief winterkorn matthias mueller , 57 , got behind the wheel at porsche at the beginning of this month , taking over from michael macht , who took a position on the vw management board , where he is now in charge of group production .
mueller , vw 's top car-model strategist , is expected to spread the success he had at vw 's audi unit to porsche .
analysts say he has the know-how to do it , as well as the support .
mueller is considered close to vw chief winterkorn and still enjoys strong support at porsche headquarters in stuttgart .
" he fits in here .
i especially like the fact that he 's not all talk .
he gets things done , " said uwe hueck , the head of porsche 's works council .
independence mueller has insisted he is not coming to stuttgart to simply do the bidding of executives in wolfsburg , where vw is based .
while wolfsburg will be involved in discussions , he said porsche will not lose its autonomy .
" if we take an active role in running this company , wolfsburg will basically leave us alone .
but if we are passive and just wait for things to happen , they 're going to take control , " mueller said at the paris auto salon last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's panamera sedan has helped sales rebound " but that 's not what they want and not why i am here .
i think they chose me for this position because they believe i can be an active element and work with my colleagues to make things happen . "
although mueller insists that porsche will largely call its own shots , automobile expert willi diez says vw will want to have its say .
mueller 's close ties with volkswagen will make it easier for him to integrate porsche into the group of vw brands .
" i think it 's certainly understandable that vw wants to strengthen its influence at porsche .
they naturally want to have someone at the top that enjoys the trust of the vw board .
also , that he runs things there in a way that volkswagen thinks is right , " he said .
a ' good move ' mueller 's resume , which includes his time as the head of audi 's product management and new model development , makes him well suited for the top job at porsche , according to juergen pieper , an automotive expert at the metzler bank .
" i think this is a good move for porsche , " he said .
" i do n't know mr. mueller personally , but i have heard from reliable sources that he is a very strong motivator , knows his cars and that he 's made a lot of positive things happen , such as at audi where his years there were very good ones .
volkswagen aims to surpass auto giant toyota in deliveries and profitability by 2018 .
its integration of porsche is part of that plan .
porsche , for its part , wants to expand its own line-up to double annual sales in the mid-term to 150,000 cars and sports utility vehicles .
