relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .

some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said .

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly .

left party general secretary dietmar bartsch announced he will step down in may amid accusations of lies , rumors and disloyalty within the party that are raising eyebrows across the country . the general secretary of germany 's left party , dietmar bartsch , announced on friday he will step down in may after being criticized for alleged disloyalty to party leader oskar lafontaine .
bartsch has reportedly suggested that lafontaine is having an affair .
bartsch that he would not run for re-election , and wanted to steer the party 's path " away from a personal debate , free to make policy . "
the relationship between bartsch and lafontaine has long been regarded as shattered .
bartsch has been accused of spreading rumors about cancer-stricken lafontaine in an effort to discredit his bid for re-election . the left party is one of germany 's newest parties , founded in 2007 by disgruntled western german trade unionists and members of the successor to the east german communist party .
it has widespread support in the eastern part of the country and has been growing in popularity in the western part of the country. smh / dpa / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success . " we want to be a strategic driving force again , " he said . acb / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

" it was the work of the east germans themselves that saved the files from destruction , " she said . the celebrations were moved from friday to saturday and sunday to ensure a large public attendance . a daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of files remain in the archives , open to the public the stasi archives are now open to the public and have attracted some 2.6 million applications for review since 1991 . the work involved in reviewing the documents and investigating crimes committed by the stasi is enormous and nowhere near finished , birthler said . among the records are some 39 million index cards , 1.44 million photos , 164,000 audio files and 7,800 electronic data carriers like floppy disks .
if laid side-by-side , the documents would stretch about 112 kilometers -lrb- 69.6 miles -rrb- . the records are still highly relevant .
late last year , two left party politicians in the eastern state of brandenburg resigned after records revealed they had both spied for the stasi . open doors germany 's openness with the gdr 's secret police records contrasts with policies of many eastern european countries , which have kept their records sealed for fear of bringing up old hatred between dissidents and their betrayers . but confronting the dark past of east germany is essential to moving forward in the future , birthler said in an interview with deutsche welle . " even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , " she said .
" but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them . " acb / epd / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dutchman jacobus petrus besteman testified on friday by video link from the netherlands .
" all those who participated were afraid of not following orders .
it was very dangerous , " he told the state court in the western german border city of aachen .
besteman added , however , that he never witnessed officers being punished for not following execution orders .
only following orders boere was sentenced in absentia by a special post-war tribunal in amsterdam in 1949 .
germany , though , refused to extradite the former ss member , saying it was unable to determine boere 's nationality .
the 88-year-old was born in the western german town of eschweiler , but his family moved to the netherlands when he was two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himmler 's ss were forced to kill , says besteman he told the court he volunteered for the ss in 1940 and served on the eastern front and in the netherlands .
boere admitted on the stand that he was involved in the 1944 killing of three civilians in the dutch towns of breda , voorschoten and wassenaar .
he has confessed to the three killings on previous occasions , claiming that he was merely following orders .
" yes , i got rid of them , " he told focus magazine in 2008 .
" it was not difficult .
you just had to bend a finger . "
if convicted the wheelchair-bound boere , who lives in a nursing home , is facing the rest of his life behind bars. glb / ap / dpa editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dutchman jacobus petrus besteman testified on friday by video link from the netherlands .
" all those who participated were afraid of not following orders .
it was very dangerous , " he told the state court in the western german border city of aachen .
besteman added , however , that he never witnessed officers being punished for not following execution orders .
only following orders boere was sentenced in absentia by a special post-war tribunal in amsterdam in 1949 .
germany , though , refused to extradite the former ss member , saying it was unable to determine boere 's nationality .
the 88-year-old was born in the western german town of eschweiler , but his family moved to the netherlands when he was two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himmler 's ss were forced to kill , says besteman he told the court he volunteered for the ss in 1940 and served on the eastern front and in the netherlands .
boere admitted on the stand that he was involved in the 1944 killing of three civilians in the dutch towns of breda , voorschoten and wassenaar .
he has confessed to the three killings on previous occasions , claiming that he was merely following orders .
" yes , i got rid of them , " he told focus magazine in 2008 .
" it was not difficult .
you just had to bend a finger . "
if convicted the wheelchair-bound boere , who lives in a nursing home , is facing the rest of his life behind bars. glb / ap / dpa editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .

dutchman jacobus petrus besteman testified on friday by video link from the netherlands .
" all those who participated were afraid of not following orders .
it was very dangerous , " he told the state court in the western german border city of aachen .
besteman added , however , that he never witnessed officers being punished for not following execution orders .
only following orders boere was sentenced in absentia by a special post-war tribunal in amsterdam in 1949 .
germany , though , refused to extradite the former ss member , saying it was unable to determine boere 's nationality .
the 88-year-old was born in the western german town of eschweiler , but his family moved to the netherlands when he was two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himmler 's ss were forced to kill , says besteman he told the court he volunteered for the ss in 1940 and served on the eastern front and in the netherlands .
boere admitted on the stand that he was involved in the 1944 killing of three civilians in the dutch towns of breda , voorschoten and wassenaar .
he has confessed to the three killings on previous occasions , claiming that he was merely following orders .

" it was the work of the east germans themselves that saved the files from destruction , " she said . the celebrations were moved from friday to saturday and sunday to ensure a large public attendance . a daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of files remain in the archives , open to the public the stasi archives are now open to the public and have attracted some 2.6 million applications for review since 1991 . the work involved in reviewing the documents and investigating crimes committed by the stasi is enormous and nowhere near finished , birthler said . among the records are some 39 million index cards , 1.44 million photos , 164,000 audio files and 7,800 electronic data carriers like floppy disks .
if laid side-by-side , the documents would stretch about 112 kilometers -lrb- 69.6 miles -rrb- . the records are still highly relevant .
late last year , two left party politicians in the eastern state of brandenburg resigned after records revealed they had both spied for the stasi . open doors germany 's openness with the gdr 's secret police records contrasts with policies of many eastern european countries , which have kept their records sealed for fear of bringing up old hatred between dissidents and their betrayers . but confronting the dark past of east germany is essential to moving forward in the future , birthler said in an interview with deutsche welle . " even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , " she said .
" but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them . " acb / epd / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

" even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , " she said .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was the work of the east germans themselves that saved the files from destruction , " she said . the celebrations were moved from friday to saturday and sunday to ensure a large public attendance . a daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of files remain in the archives , open to the public the stasi archives are now open to the public and have attracted some 2.6 million applications for review since 1991 . the work involved in reviewing the documents and investigating crimes committed by the stasi is enormous and nowhere near finished , birthler said . among the records are some 39 million index cards , 1.44 million photos , 164,000 audio files and 7,800 electronic data carriers like floppy disks .
if laid side-by-side , the documents would stretch about 112 kilometers -lrb- 69.6 miles -rrb- . the records are still highly relevant .
late last year , two left party politicians in the eastern state of brandenburg resigned after records revealed they had both spied for the stasi . open doors germany 's openness with the gdr 's secret police records contrasts with policies of many eastern european countries , which have kept their records sealed for fear of bringing up old hatred between dissidents and their betrayers . but confronting the dark past of east germany is essential to moving forward in the future , birthler said in an interview with deutsche welle . " even in the initial years after 1990 , there was a desire to close the curtain and not worry about all this , " she said .
" but this changed when it was realized that keeping secret files closed could be more dangerous than opening them . " acb / epd / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers .

" by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "

with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .

" but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .

some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we definitely think we should maintain the 30 percent offer , " british energy and climate change minister ed miliband told reporters in sevilla , spain , where he took part in the informal meeting of eu environment ministers . " it has always been a conditional offer but it is a very important signal that it is maintained , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister roettgen said europe should be a " driving force " ahead of the climate talks in denmark , the 27-member bloc had agreed to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent over the next decade from 1990 levels , and to deepen those cuts to 30 percent if other nations followed suit . belgian climate minister jean-louis borloo said raising the eu 's target to 30 percent give european firms a " first mover advantage " and it could inspire heavy polluters like china , india and the united states to set more ambitious goals . " by staying with our 20 percent target we might take the risk of losing the opportunity for major industrial change , " he said . but other eu countries such as italy have opposed raising emission cut goals out of fears their business sector will suffer competitive disadvantages . looking ahead to bonn , mexico while media outlets across the globe widely dubbed the copenhagen convention a failure , the world could take a stab at reaching a binding climate change treaty at the next un climate conferences in bonn in mid-2010 and in mexico at the end of the year . the greenhouse gas emission cuts written into the 1997 kyoto protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and europe hopes to be influential in the search for a successor . german environment minister norbert roettgen said european countries needed to discuss what they did not do to make copenhagen a success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 16.01.2010 political rivalries rage as ukrainians go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko , left , and yanukovich lead the field of candidates after years of political instability , ukrainians go to the polls sunday in a presidential election which they hope will bring strong leadership to the former soviet state .
russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .
the pro-western leader , who has been accused himself of plunging ukraine into political disarray , has warned that tymoshenko is looking to disrupt the election and is seeking absolute power . the stylish 49-year-old with the braided hair has so far ignored yushchenko – who is expected to drop out in the first round amid widespread public perceptions of political mismanagement – and chosen to focus her attentions on discrediting yanukovich .
tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tymoshenko has accused her main rival of preparing to rig ballots , preventing citizens from voting and hiring street marchers to intimidate her supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polished tymoshenko has turned on sturdy yanukovich the descent into mud-slinging as opposed to campaigning on issues is largely due to the fact that very little divides the policies of yanukovich and tymoshenko . both have pledged to rebuild damaged ties with moscow while moving closer to mainstream europe .
however , yanukovich – who appeals to the industrialists – can rely on russia 's support while tymoshenko – who plays on her reputation as a national savior – can expect strong backing from the europeans . " the election is really not a battle of ideologies so much as a battle of personalities , " stephen bandera , political editor at the kiev post , told deutsche welle .
" the candidates are neither really pro-west nor pro-russia , they are first foremost ' pro themselves ' or their own pockets to be precise .
they will tell the west what it wants to hear and the same for russia . " while some ukrainians may see the election as a straight vote between the sturdy , authoritarian yanukovich and the glamorous , energetic tymoshenko , others realize that the former soviet republic must decide on a leadership that will help it find its place in mainstream europe while plotting a delicate course in relations with russia . russian influence such a balancing act may prove difficult for any president and government , considering the influence moscow still has over kiev , both directly and indirectly . " russia made it clear that it absolutely will not accept a second yushchenko presidency , promising ukrainians cheaper natural gas prices if they do not vote for him , " said bandera . " ukrainians themselves have decided they want to be part of europe , but europe remains closed to ukraine because countries like france and germany are beholden to russia and view ukraine in context of their relations with russia .
god forbid that they should anger putin or gazprom , " he added . jana kobzova , a ukraine expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle that the issue of european integration is not an important one this time round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich may become the west 's favored candidate " the pro-west – pro-russia divide is not as salient in this election as it was in the orange revolution , " she said .
" both yanukovich and tymoshenko vaguely support eu integration . " she said that tymoshenko did beef up her eu rhetoric recently by promising that if elected , she would do everything possible to bring ukraine to the european union during her presidency . " but generally , the eu is not among the key focuses of the campaign , " she said , adding that the election is mainly about stopping the economic and political chaos that has afflicted ukraine . this situation may be of more advantage to yanukovich who could find that the west might prefer to forget its old animosity towards him in favor of a leadership which could bring stability . yanukovich is seen by the west as a pragmatist who may take a slower approach to rapprochement with the eu , while tymoshenko is viewed as a more enthusiastic supporter of european integration but also as being more unpredictable . no swift solution to leadership battle it is highly unlikely that sunday 's vote will decide who will govern ukraine .
no candidate is expected to poll the 50 percent required for outright victory and , given the nature of ukrainian politics , analysts do not rule out a political co-habitation between tymoshenko and yanukovich after the election . none of the candidates have scored more than 35 percent support in the pre-election opinion polls , so analysts say the eventual winner will have likely just eked out a victory . " combined , public opinion poll leaders yanukovich and tymoshenko barely have 50 percent combined support .
thus , the country still does not have a truly national leader who is able to consolidate and rally the ukrainian people , " said stephen bandera . some say that a run-off for the presidency – set for feb .
7 – could see tymoshenko overturn even a lead as big as the ten point advantage yanukovich has over her now to deny him the presidency for the second time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one candidate has the support needed to lead alone should yanukovich hold onto or increase his lead to win outright , it is likely that he would snub tymoshenko , dissolve parliament and call new parliamentary elections to form a government loyal to him .
some experts are even forecasting a challenge by tymoshenko should yanukovich win , either by appealing to the courts or even going as far as trying to bring people out on to the streets as she did in 2004 . " with either of the two winning , strengthening and concentration of presidential powers is one of the likely outcomes , " jana kobzova said . " president yanukovich would probably have to call for an early election to gain a working majority in the parliament , " she added .
" if tymoshenko loses the presidential election , she is likely to contest the outcome at courts .
if the political in-fighting continues after the election , ukraine is likely to see even more economic and political chaos . " author : nick amies editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia and the eu will be hoping for the same . the final days before the ukrainian presidential election on sunday were colored not by flags of orange but by murky accusations of attempted fraud and the garish bunting of flip-flopping populism .
with fiery prime minister yulia tymoshenko and bitter opponent viktor yanukovich leading the pack of eighteen candidates , the rivalries and distrust which have been simmering between the two front-runners since the 2004 " orange revolution " have reached boiling point as the final campaign phase goes into overdrive . the once-discredited yanukovich , the presidential race 's leader according to public opinion surveys , is seemingly back from the dead after being disgraced by a rigged election .
he is promising a cash-strapped populace widespread pension and minimum-wage increases if elected . yanukovich leads regions ukraine , a political party supporting close relations with russia and government assistance to ukrainian big business .
he also promises to solve the sevastopol issue - the row between ukraine and russia over the use of the crimean port for the russian naval fleet .
the issue is an open sore in relations with moscow and one which threatens to undermine an agreement which currently brings much-needed revenue to ukraine 's dwindling financial reserves . sturdy pragmatist versus energetic stateswoman tymoshenko , currently running second in popularity polls , some 10 points behind yanukovich , has run a glitzy campaign of pop jingles and populist slogans but has suffered from being attacked publicly by current president viktor yushchenko , her former patron .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .

on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "

with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .

relief workers fear the country could descend into lawlessness if supplies are not distributed quickly . survivors of haiti 's devastating earthquake are still waiting desperately for aid , as hunger and dwindling patience have prompted looting and sparked fears that the country , already stricken by poverty and a weak infrastructure before the disaster , could descend into anarchy .
haitian authorities say as many as 200,000 people are thought to be dead following tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude quake , which , according to statements made by a un spokeswoman on saturday , is the worst disaster the international body has ever confronted .
" this is a historic disaster .
we have never been confronted with such a disaster in un memory .
it is like no other , " elisabeth byrs of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told the afp news agency .
four days after tuesday 's catastrophe , the haitian government admitted it was no longer able to function properly .
the government in the capital port-au-prince gave the united states control over its main airport to bring order to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the impoverished caribbean nation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief aid left the german red cross center in berlin on saturday morning us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was expected to arrive in the haitian capital on saturday to begin overseeing the relief effort , which is struggling with the lack of police oversight , scarce food and water , and a shortage of medical supplies to treat the wounded . a glut of decomposing bodies yet to be dug out of the rubble has added the threat of disease to survivors ' growing list of worries .
on friday , clinton cited a " race against time " before anxiety and anger create additional problems .
relief workers have echoed those concerns , saying that unless supplies are quickly delivered , port-au-prince will degenerate into lawlessness .
" there have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food .
they are desperate , they have been three days without food or any assistance , " un undersecretary-general for peacekeeping alain le roy told " the pbs newshour . "
criminals on the loose " men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , " evelyne buino , a beautician , told afp .
the source of buino 's fear is a nearby jail , from which 4,000 convicts escaped when the earthquake destroyed the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have a lack of medical supplies with which to treat the wounded " all the bandits of the city are now on the streets , " a local police man told afp .
" they are robbing people .
it is a big problem . "
with the presidential palace in shambles , government operations have been relocated to a local police station near the airport . president rene preval is now working in an office protected by two guards from his security detail .
preval has admitted that the haitian government 's response had been ineffective .
" the government has lost its capacity to function properly , but it has not collapsed , " said the president .
inadequate infrastructure although over 74 countries have responded to the crisis by sending aid to haiti , the effort remains largely uncoordinated , and relief has been slow to reach survivors .
food and water , as well as tents , blankets , and medical supplies are making their way into the country , but the lack of infrastructure has slowed their delivery .
american troops who have taken charge at the capital 's clogged airport - haiti 's only link to the outside world - are trying to organize delivery of aid to anxious survivors in the capital .
on saturday , the netherlands dispatched a warship carrying supplies after a plane they previously sent was unable to land at the crowded airport .
a plane carrying a portable medical clinic from the german red cross left berlin on saturday , and is expected to arrive in haiti on sunday morning. smh / afp / rtre editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dutchman jacobus petrus besteman testified on friday by video link from the netherlands .
" all those who participated were afraid of not following orders .
it was very dangerous , " he told the state court in the western german border city of aachen .
besteman added , however , that he never witnessed officers being punished for not following execution orders .
only following orders boere was sentenced in absentia by a special post-war tribunal in amsterdam in 1949 .
germany , though , refused to extradite the former ss member , saying it was unable to determine boere 's nationality .
the 88-year-old was born in the western german town of eschweiler , but his family moved to the netherlands when he was two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : himmler 's ss were forced to kill , says besteman he told the court he volunteered for the ss in 1940 and served on the eastern front and in the netherlands .
boere admitted on the stand that he was involved in the 1944 killing of three civilians in the dutch towns of breda , voorschoten and wassenaar .
he has confessed to the three killings on previous occasions , claiming that he was merely following orders .
" yes , i got rid of them , " he told focus magazine in 2008 .
" it was not difficult .
you just had to bend a finger . "
if convicted the wheelchair-bound boere , who lives in a nursing home , is facing the rest of his life behind bars. glb / ap / dpa editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
