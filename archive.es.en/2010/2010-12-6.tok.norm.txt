bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 06.12.2010 food hotel combines suites with sweets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel guests may experience a craving for biscuits if you 're into food – really into food – you may want to spend a night or two at the food hotel on germany 's rhine river .
its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .

its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .
greece briefly halted the sending of mail and parcels abroad after a package addressed to merkel arrived at the chancellery office in berlin .
another package , addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , was discovered on board a plane at bologna airport .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

but forest fires in israel may have restarted communication . last may 's killing of nine turkish citizens by israeli security forces as they seized a ship trying to break its embargo on gaza saw bilateral relations collapse amid bitter mutual recriminations .
but the fatal forest fire that struck israel last week may have become an opportunity for thawing relations between tel aviv and ankara . in a surprise move , turkey sent two firefighting planes to israel to help contain the deadly blaze .
following ankara 's decision to send the planes to israel , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu placed a telephone call to his turkish counterpart to thank him .
this was the first conversation the two leaders have had since the deadly incident last may .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also used an address to his supporters over the weekend to tentatively reach out to israel " some say we should turn a new page … an apology must be offered first , compensation must be paid first , " erdogan said .
" if a hand is extended , we will not leave it in the air , but we want to see that this hand is extended with sincerity . "
closed-door talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sent planes to help fight the fire in israel the apparent softening of his stance has also been matched by a diplomatic move .
over the weekend there was a high-level meeting of turkish and israeli diplomats in geneva , although no details of the talks were released .
this comes at a time when ankara is facing mounting pressure from its allies to mend fences with israel .
last month the head of the us senate foreign relations committee , john kerry , met with erdogan .
" it is in the interests of everyone - turks , israelis americans and others - that the relationship , an important one between turkey and israel , be renewed , " kerry said .
that stance has been echoed in europe .
in october , german president christian wulff used his visit to turkey to stress the importance of turkish-israel relations .
the european union has also called on ankara to improve ties , and observers say ankara is also facing growing pressure on the issue from middle eastern leaders .
until the collapse in bilateral relations , turkey had been playing a key role as a mediator in peace talks between israel and the palestinians .
but political scientist cengiz aktar says the collapse in relations with israel has significantly curtailed turkey 's regional influence .
" these peace and mediation efforts are dead .
so turkey 's stance around the world can not survive by antagonizing israel , " said aktar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan may be softening his stance on israel diplomatic challenge the turkish-israeli tensions are seen as just another destabilizing factor in already unstable region .
but while pressure is mounting on ankara to resolve its differences , analysts say to do so will require a good deal of diplomatic skill .
" the government has engaged itself very concretely on these topics and would not want to give the impression of stepping down at this moment , " diplomatic correspondent semih idiz told deutsche welle .
" this would cost the government domestically in the political environment that we have in the country at the moment .
so we have a bit of stalemate in which turkey is expected to take steps but is not in a position to do so because of domestic politics . "
with a general election scheduled for next june , domestic policy is of heightened importance .
while the populist anti-israel stance that erdogan espoused until the past few days may win him some votes , this comes at a high cost for turkey 's international reputation .

the two heads of state have agreed to set up a memorial to the victims of the smolensk disaster . the decision to dedicate a memorial to the victims of april 's plane crash in smolensk , russia was considered the most significant agreement made during russian president dmitry medvedev 's visit to poland on monday .
poland 's then-president lech kaczynski and 95 other victims were killed in the plane crash while on their way to a commemoration of the katyn massacre .
medvedev vowed that the russian side of the crash investigation would be objective , and he promised to assist in uncovering the full truth of the soviet massacre of polish officers in world war ii .
new chapter " i 'm convinced we are beginning not only a new chapter in polish-russian relations , but also a good chapter in the book of bilateral relations that we have been writing for the last 1,000 years , " said polish president bronislaw komorowski following his meeting with the russian president .
medvedev was given a very warm welcome .
following talks between the two delegations , komorowski told a news conference that the dry spell in relations with russia was definitely over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev said poland was helping russia build relations with the west " it will probably be a very long road , but we are determined to go down this path and many goals will be defined jointly by poland and russia , " komorowski said .
komorowski added that the focus of the talks had been on the economy , prospects for developing transport infrastructure between the two countries , building bridges between the two nations based on a new system of youth exchange schemes and developing links with the russian kaliningrad enclave squeezed between poland and lithuania .
medvedev also spoke about poland 's new role in helping russia forge relations with the west .
" we are currently building multidimensional relations with the eu and nato .
the involvement of our polish colleagues will be conducive toward resolving issues that emerge during this dialogue , " he said .
the russian president also spoke about moscow 's determination to get to the root of difficult moments in polish-russian history , notably the katyn forest massacre during world war ii in which thousands of polish pows were executed on stalin 's orders .
the russian parliament recently issued a declaration apologizing for the soviet war crime against poland .
a set of documents related to the issue was presented to the polish side during medvedev 's visit .
" in our history , there were bright sides , but also difficult and dark ones .
and in life , it is important to try to separate history , whatever it may be , from the present , " medvedev told a polish weekly news magazine on monday .
" otherwise , we will always be hostage of the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : komorowski follows a pragmatic approach towards russia russia admits its role in the katyn massacre according to observers , moscow 's willingness to finally admit to its role in the massacre following decades of disinformation and blaming the crime on the nazis , has convinced many ordinary polish citizens .
in spite of protests by smalls groups of demonstrators representing poland 's right wing nationalist groups , both sides went out of their way to make it a success during medvedev 's visit .
since the death of former president kaczynski , who had steered a confrontational course in relations with moscow , komorowski has decided to adopt a more pragmatic approach towards russia .
in the past , successive polish governments were criticized by their counterparts in the eu for being anti-russian and blocking any attempts to build a more pragmatic relationship with moscow , something that now definitely seems a thing of the past .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

" the chinese government is outraged because the nobel committee has awarded the prize to liu xiaobo .
now , they have put hundreds of people on the exit control list . " numerous chinese dissidents , academics and lawyers , including liu xiaobo 's lawyer , were kept from travelling abroad last week .
apparently , chinese officials feared that he might also fly to oslo .
according to the chinese civil rights groups , several other dissidents were denied travel documents by the chinese government .

he is currently in jail because he has broken chinese laws .
this is a proof of their overt support to the illegal activities in china – an outright provocation , and an interference in our judicial sovereignty , " said jiang . china , in return , has come under fire for its stance on liu .
former czech president vaclav havel and nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu urged beijing to free liu from jail , and his wife from house arrest . oslo is gearing up for the prestigious ceremony with neither the laureate nor any of his close associates attending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .

the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek journalist giolias was killed at his home counter-terrorism police said the weapons were typical of those used by the left-wing guerrilla group sect of revolutionaries which has claimed responsibility for the murder in july of sokratis giolas , a prominent investigative journalist .
however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .
greece briefly halted the sending of mail and parcels abroad after a package addressed to merkel arrived at the chancellery office in berlin .
another package , addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , was discovered on board a plane at bologna airport .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

before the meeting , the 5 + 1 team said it would hold firm to its position that iran should stop enriching uranium . day one of the first talks in more than a year between iran and six world powers about iran 's nuclear program wrapped up on monday in geneva .
while both sides do not consider a breakthrough in negotiations likely , gradual confidence-building is seen as an attainable goal . the second of three days of talks was due to begin on tuesday .
the united states , britain , germany , france , russia and china -lrb- the so-called 5 + 1 group -rrb- are worried iran could use its uranium enrichment plants to make fuel for warheads rather than reactors .
5 + 1 want tehran to stop enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief negotiators catherine ashton and iran 's saeed jalili the 5 + 1 diplomatic team is headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton and it is expected they will hold firm in demanding that iran cooperate fully with the iaea and obey the provisions of various security council resolutions which state that it should stop enriching uranium .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle has called on iran to take advantage of the opportunity offered in geneva and create some necessary transparency in its nuclear program .
a nuclear-armed iran would create " unpredictable consequences for regional and international stability , " said westerwelle .
however the civil use of nuclear energy would be tolerated , he added .
sanctions fail four rounds of united nations sanctions have not been able to pressure tehran 's leaders to halt enrichment .
iran says its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes .
over the weekend , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said iran 's right to seek nuclear technology was " non-negotiable . "
on sunday , iran claimed to have become self-sufficient in uranium concentrate , or yellowcake .
according to the khabar news network , the first batch was produced in the gachin uranium mine in southern iran .
iran 's atomic chief ali-akbar salehi said the process was made under the supervision of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.12.2010 developers around the world push for open data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developers at the open data hackathon plan new apps the international open data hackathon kicked off in berlin and more than 50 other cities worldwide on saturday .
developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .

its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.12.2010 developers around the world push for open data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developers at the open data hackathon plan new apps the international open data hackathon kicked off in berlin and more than 50 other cities worldwide on saturday .
developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

but in a paper published today in the journal physical review letters , yasunori yamazaki , a cern antimatter researcher , said his experiment had succeeded in creating a significant number of antihydrogen atoms in flight , a development which will ultimately help him and his team understand the enigmas of antimatter .
at the time of the big bang , approximately 15 billion years ago , equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been created , but the latter appears to have disappeared , and to look into the universe is to see nothing but former .
the theoretical explanation for that imbalance is that in the first seconds of the universe the number of matter particles very fractionally outnumbered that of antimatter , and that when the two made contact and rapidly began to annihilate each other , the only thing that survived was the excess matter .
that being the case , scientists have never been able to get a handle on antimatter .
but they are working hard to fill that gap .
one way of doing so is to take a hydrogen atom , which consists of one proton and one electron , and see whether its antimatter counterpart , antihydrogen , which is made up of an antiproton and a positron , shares its behavioral properties .
if they were able to detect differences between the two , researchers would have some insight into what happened at the very beginning of life as we have come to know it .
" by solving this question , " yamazaki said in an interview with deutsche welle , " we would have a basis of our existence . "
in for the long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at work at cern this new discovery comes approximately two weeks after the same cern team announced that they had trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms .
the cern scientists have spent the past five years working on ways of creating antihydrogen atoms to be kept away from ordinary matter in order to study its behavioral properties .
they produced the antihydrogen atoms by using what is known as a cusp trap to bring a combination of magnetic fields and antiprotons together and subsequently channeled the atoms along a vacuum pipe where they can be studied in flight .
although the technique is still a long way from providing the world with an insight into the whereabouts of antimatter , yamazaki said the method of producing and eventually studying antihydrogen means it is only a question of time before the secrets of antimatter are unlocked .
symmetry versus non-symmetry to get there , he and his team are trying to understand the charge , parity and time -lrb- cpt -rrb- symmetry between matter and antimatter .
at the moment the symmetry is believed to exist , but the physicists are planning to do high precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen to gain greater knowledge .
bildunterschrift : the world 's largest particle physics laboratory as seen from above " if our experiment reveals non-conservation of the cpt symmetry in some way , it would be a really revolutionary discovery , " yamazaki said .
" i am very much looking forward to getting some information on the cpr symmetry and the mystery of the non-existence of antimatter in our universe . "
he says the first simple spectroscopy could take place as early as next year , but that the more earnest spectroscopy which could reveal deviation of antihydrogen from hydrogen would take several years to get prepare .
a long way from practical use thomas lohse , particle physics at berlin 's humboldt university , welcomed the progress , which he said he hoped would answer some very specific questions .
" if the antihydrogen atom is the same as the hydrogen one , does the light have the same frequency ? " he mused .
" another interesting issue is whether antihydrogen would fall to the floor or float upwards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if herz 's discovery can spawn our electronic age , what might come next ?
he believes it could take decades before scientists truly understand the properties of antimatter , and even longer before their findings are put to practical use .
but that is par for the course in the world of physics .
and to highlight the point , lohse cited gustav herz 's discovery that electromagnetism could produce electromagnetic waves .
" at the time people asked what it was good for , but without electromagnetic waves we would not have satellites , radios , televisions , modern communication , " lohse told deutsche welle .
" it is possible that there will be an application for antimatter , but it is hard to predict . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo diplomacy -pipe- 06.12.2010 wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release of sensitive cables could result in a new push for secrecy after the attacks of september 11 , 2001 governments worldwide focused on sharing information to combat terrorism .
but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek journalist giolias was killed at his home counter-terrorism police said the weapons were typical of those used by the left-wing guerrilla group sect of revolutionaries which has claimed responsibility for the murder in july of sokratis giolas , a prominent investigative journalist .
however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .

developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 06.12.2010 food hotel combines suites with sweets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel guests may experience a craving for biscuits if you 're into food – really into food – you may want to spend a night or two at the food hotel on germany 's rhine river .
its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo diplomacy -pipe- 06.12.2010 wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release of sensitive cables could result in a new push for secrecy after the attacks of september 11 , 2001 governments worldwide focused on sharing information to combat terrorism .
but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.12.2010 eu divided over euro bonds , no increase in bailout funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurogroup head juncker has called for joint euro bonds there was no agreement on plans for joint euro bonds at a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers in brussels on monday , where the eurogroup decided against any increase in the rescue fund for debt-saddled countries . european ministers took no new steps on extending a eurozone emergency fund on monday after member states failed to reach agreement on the necessary steps to be taken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu treaty does not allow for euro bonds a five-hour meeting of financial ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro concluded that the existing fund was sufficient .
there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .

van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .

that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .

developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

german foreign minister guido westerwelle has called on iran to take advantage of the opportunity offered in geneva and create some necessary transparency in its nuclear program .
a nuclear-armed iran would create " unpredictable consequences for regional and international stability , " said westerwelle .
however the civil use of nuclear energy would be tolerated , he added .
sanctions fail four rounds of united nations sanctions have not been able to pressure tehran 's leaders to halt enrichment .
iran says its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes .
over the weekend , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said iran 's right to seek nuclear technology was " non-negotiable . "
on sunday , iran claimed to have become self-sufficient in uranium concentrate , or yellowcake .
according to the khabar news network , the first batch was produced in the gachin uranium mine in southern iran .
iran 's atomic chief ali-akbar salehi said the process was made under the supervision of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .

the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .

" we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.12.2010 eu divided over euro bonds , no increase in bailout funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurogroup head juncker has called for joint euro bonds there was no agreement on plans for joint euro bonds at a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers in brussels on monday , where the eurogroup decided against any increase in the rescue fund for debt-saddled countries . european ministers took no new steps on extending a eurozone emergency fund on monday after member states failed to reach agreement on the necessary steps to be taken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu treaty does not allow for euro bonds a five-hour meeting of financial ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro concluded that the existing fund was sufficient .
there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

prior to the ceremony on friday in oslo , the chinese authorities have tightened their grip on dissidents . chinese artist ai weiwei was about to fly from china to south korea .
from there , he had to continue his journey to berlin , and then to denmark .
one hour prior to his departure from beijing international airport , ai weiwei was getting ready to board his airplane . he was waiting in the departure lounge when a police officer came in .
the police officer wanted to check his passport again , saying there had been some problems with his passport inspection .
" at that moment it became clear to me that they wanted to stop me from leaving the country " , said ai .
" later on , she showed me an order issued by the department of public security , stating that my departure would compromise china ’ s national security . " exit control list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei is not only an artist but also an advocate for civil rights in china though ai weiwei had no plans to travel to oslo to attend the nobel peace prize ceremony , he believes that the travel restrictions on him are linked to the upcoming ceremony .
" the chinese government is outraged because the nobel committee has awarded the prize to liu xiaobo .
now , they have put hundreds of people on the exit control list . " numerous chinese dissidents , academics and lawyers , including liu xiaobo 's lawyer , were kept from travelling abroad last week .
apparently , chinese officials feared that he might also fly to oslo .
according to the chinese civil rights groups , several other dissidents were denied travel documents by the chinese government .
this includes sun wanguan , a university professor from shandong province in eastern china .
he had been invited by liu xia , the nobel laureate ’ s wife , to come to norway to attend the ceremony . cut off from any contact liu xiaobo is currently serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges .

he is currently in jail because he has broken chinese laws .
this is a proof of their overt support to the illegal activities in china – an outright provocation , and an interference in our judicial sovereignty , " said jiang . china , in return , has come under fire for its stance on liu .
former czech president vaclav havel and nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu urged beijing to free liu from jail , and his wife from house arrest . oslo is gearing up for the prestigious ceremony with neither the laureate nor any of his close associates attending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.12.2010 developers around the world push for open data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developers at the open data hackathon plan new apps the international open data hackathon kicked off in berlin and more than 50 other cities worldwide on saturday .
developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .

racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .

developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 06.12.2010 food hotel combines suites with sweets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hotel guests may experience a craving for biscuits if you 're into food – really into food – you may want to spend a night or two at the food hotel on germany 's rhine river .
its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .

luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .

germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.12.2010 eu divided over euro bonds , no increase in bailout funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurogroup head juncker has called for joint euro bonds there was no agreement on plans for joint euro bonds at a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers in brussels on monday , where the eurogroup decided against any increase in the rescue fund for debt-saddled countries . european ministers took no new steps on extending a eurozone emergency fund on monday after member states failed to reach agreement on the necessary steps to be taken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu treaty does not allow for euro bonds a five-hour meeting of financial ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro concluded that the existing fund was sufficient .
there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?

the attack took place at a government-backed tribal meeting in mohmand agency . most of the dead included tribal leaders , policemen , and civilians .
among the dead are two local journalists who were covering the meeting for local television channels .
eyewitnesses have painted a picture of devastation and mayhem of the incident .
" there was a deafening sound and it caused a cloud of dust and smoke and a subsequent hue and cry , " forty-five year old qalandar khan was quoted by pakistan 's local media .
the injured have been rushed to the hospitals in peshawar .
according to mian iftikhar hussein , the information minister of khyber pakhtunkwa province , most of the injured are in a critical condition .
taliban stronghold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers walk through the rubble at the site of the bombing in ghalalnai the area bordering afghanistan is considered a stronghold of the taliban .
the aim of the tribal meeting was to discuss the formation of an anti-taliban militia .
there have been several anti-taliban militias in the region which are supported by the pakistani government in an attempt to fight the extremists with local support .
the pakistan army has launched several military operations to rid the area of the taliban and al-qaeda militants .
on the other side , the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan -lrb- ttp -rrb- has been carrying out attacks on security personnel and the tribal militias .
though no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , government officials are blaming it on the taliban .
the attack was carried out in a government compound of ghalalnai , the central town of mohmand agency , 175 km north-west of the capital islamabad .
two men disguised as policemen tried to sneak into the compound , where the tribal elders had gathered to formulate their strategy against the taliban , and detonated the bombs .
one of the bombers was intercepted at the gate of the compound ; however , he was still able to blow himself up .
according to the local news channels , the possible target of the attack could be mohmand agency 's top political agent amjad ali khan , who remained unhurt in the attack .
last month , a similar attack took place in a mosque in darra adam khel , killing at least 67 people .
according to the local sources , the mosque was frequented by the pro-government tribal leaders .
combating taliban with local support according to owais tohid , correspondent of christian science monitor in karachi , the ttp has been regularly attacking jirgas -lrb- assemblies of tribal leaders -rrb- in every tribal agency since 2007 .
he believes that the aim of the pakistani taliban behind targeting the tribal elders is to create a vacuum in which nobody could challenge their power .
" any dissent , any voice against them is obviously a threat for them , and they want to silence it , " tohid told deutsche welle .
but is the support of the pakistani government adequate to battle the militants ?
tohid believes that the support is both political and logistical , albeit the tribal leaders often complain that the government is not doing enough , and sufficient protection has not been provided to them by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of a local citizens ' militia waving his rifle in the bajaur tribal region " naturally , if you have such lethal attacks , you wo n't have any voice of dissent for some time , and that is the aim of the taliban .
we must not forget that last year the anti-taliban militias of mohmand agency were responsible for handing over maulvi omar to the authorities , who happened to be one of the main spokespersons of the ttp . "
owais tohid denies that the government approach could create a civil war-like situation and considers the support of the tribal leaders vital in the fight against militants .
however , several rights groups and peace activists have criticised the government ’ s strategy of arming the tribal leaders .
they are of the opinion that this would create a perpetual war-like situation in the region , and that the government should only support the local leaders politically .
on the other hand , the government has reiterated its commitment to the fight against terrorism .
" we are not scared of such attacks and will keep on taking these enemies of humanity to task until they disappear from society , " said mian iftikhar hussein .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

the attack took place at a government-backed tribal meeting in mohmand agency . most of the dead included tribal leaders , policemen , and civilians .
among the dead are two local journalists who were covering the meeting for local television channels .
eyewitnesses have painted a picture of devastation and mayhem of the incident .
" there was a deafening sound and it caused a cloud of dust and smoke and a subsequent hue and cry , " forty-five year old qalandar khan was quoted by pakistan 's local media .
the injured have been rushed to the hospitals in peshawar .
according to mian iftikhar hussein , the information minister of khyber pakhtunkwa province , most of the injured are in a critical condition .
taliban stronghold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers walk through the rubble at the site of the bombing in ghalalnai the area bordering afghanistan is considered a stronghold of the taliban .
the aim of the tribal meeting was to discuss the formation of an anti-taliban militia .
there have been several anti-taliban militias in the region which are supported by the pakistani government in an attempt to fight the extremists with local support .
the pakistan army has launched several military operations to rid the area of the taliban and al-qaeda militants .
on the other side , the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan -lrb- ttp -rrb- has been carrying out attacks on security personnel and the tribal militias .
though no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , government officials are blaming it on the taliban .
the attack was carried out in a government compound of ghalalnai , the central town of mohmand agency , 175 km north-west of the capital islamabad .
two men disguised as policemen tried to sneak into the compound , where the tribal elders had gathered to formulate their strategy against the taliban , and detonated the bombs .
one of the bombers was intercepted at the gate of the compound ; however , he was still able to blow himself up .
according to the local news channels , the possible target of the attack could be mohmand agency 's top political agent amjad ali khan , who remained unhurt in the attack .
last month , a similar attack took place in a mosque in darra adam khel , killing at least 67 people .
according to the local sources , the mosque was frequented by the pro-government tribal leaders .
combating taliban with local support according to owais tohid , correspondent of christian science monitor in karachi , the ttp has been regularly attacking jirgas -lrb- assemblies of tribal leaders -rrb- in every tribal agency since 2007 .
he believes that the aim of the pakistani taliban behind targeting the tribal elders is to create a vacuum in which nobody could challenge their power .
" any dissent , any voice against them is obviously a threat for them , and they want to silence it , " tohid told deutsche welle .
but is the support of the pakistani government adequate to battle the militants ?
tohid believes that the support is both political and logistical , albeit the tribal leaders often complain that the government is not doing enough , and sufficient protection has not been provided to them by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of a local citizens ' militia waving his rifle in the bajaur tribal region " naturally , if you have such lethal attacks , you wo n't have any voice of dissent for some time , and that is the aim of the taliban .
we must not forget that last year the anti-taliban militias of mohmand agency were responsible for handing over maulvi omar to the authorities , who happened to be one of the main spokespersons of the ttp . "
owais tohid denies that the government approach could create a civil war-like situation and considers the support of the tribal leaders vital in the fight against militants .
however , several rights groups and peace activists have criticised the government ’ s strategy of arming the tribal leaders .
they are of the opinion that this would create a perpetual war-like situation in the region , and that the government should only support the local leaders politically .
on the other hand , the government has reiterated its commitment to the fight against terrorism .
" we are not scared of such attacks and will keep on taking these enemies of humanity to task until they disappear from society , " said mian iftikhar hussein .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.12.2010 eu divided over euro bonds , no increase in bailout funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurogroup head juncker has called for joint euro bonds there was no agreement on plans for joint euro bonds at a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers in brussels on monday , where the eurogroup decided against any increase in the rescue fund for debt-saddled countries . european ministers took no new steps on extending a eurozone emergency fund on monday after member states failed to reach agreement on the necessary steps to be taken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu treaty does not allow for euro bonds a five-hour meeting of financial ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro concluded that the existing fund was sufficient .
there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

but in a paper published today in the journal physical review letters , yasunori yamazaki , a cern antimatter researcher , said his experiment had succeeded in creating a significant number of antihydrogen atoms in flight , a development which will ultimately help him and his team understand the enigmas of antimatter .
at the time of the big bang , approximately 15 billion years ago , equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been created , but the latter appears to have disappeared , and to look into the universe is to see nothing but former .
the theoretical explanation for that imbalance is that in the first seconds of the universe the number of matter particles very fractionally outnumbered that of antimatter , and that when the two made contact and rapidly began to annihilate each other , the only thing that survived was the excess matter .
that being the case , scientists have never been able to get a handle on antimatter .
but they are working hard to fill that gap .
one way of doing so is to take a hydrogen atom , which consists of one proton and one electron , and see whether its antimatter counterpart , antihydrogen , which is made up of an antiproton and a positron , shares its behavioral properties .
if they were able to detect differences between the two , researchers would have some insight into what happened at the very beginning of life as we have come to know it .
" by solving this question , " yamazaki said in an interview with deutsche welle , " we would have a basis of our existence . "
in for the long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at work at cern this new discovery comes approximately two weeks after the same cern team announced that they had trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms .
the cern scientists have spent the past five years working on ways of creating antihydrogen atoms to be kept away from ordinary matter in order to study its behavioral properties .
they produced the antihydrogen atoms by using what is known as a cusp trap to bring a combination of magnetic fields and antiprotons together and subsequently channeled the atoms along a vacuum pipe where they can be studied in flight .
although the technique is still a long way from providing the world with an insight into the whereabouts of antimatter , yamazaki said the method of producing and eventually studying antihydrogen means it is only a question of time before the secrets of antimatter are unlocked .
symmetry versus non-symmetry to get there , he and his team are trying to understand the charge , parity and time -lrb- cpt -rrb- symmetry between matter and antimatter .
at the moment the symmetry is believed to exist , but the physicists are planning to do high precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen to gain greater knowledge .
bildunterschrift : the world 's largest particle physics laboratory as seen from above " if our experiment reveals non-conservation of the cpt symmetry in some way , it would be a really revolutionary discovery , " yamazaki said .
" i am very much looking forward to getting some information on the cpr symmetry and the mystery of the non-existence of antimatter in our universe . "
he says the first simple spectroscopy could take place as early as next year , but that the more earnest spectroscopy which could reveal deviation of antihydrogen from hydrogen would take several years to get prepare .
a long way from practical use thomas lohse , particle physics at berlin 's humboldt university , welcomed the progress , which he said he hoped would answer some very specific questions .
" if the antihydrogen atom is the same as the hydrogen one , does the light have the same frequency ? " he mused .
" another interesting issue is whether antihydrogen would fall to the floor or float upwards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if herz 's discovery can spawn our electronic age , what might come next ?
he believes it could take decades before scientists truly understand the properties of antimatter , and even longer before their findings are put to practical use .
but that is par for the course in the world of physics .
and to highlight the point , lohse cited gustav herz 's discovery that electromagnetism could produce electromagnetic waves .
" at the time people asked what it was good for , but without electromagnetic waves we would not have satellites , radios , televisions , modern communication , " lohse told deutsche welle .
" it is possible that there will be an application for antimatter , but it is hard to predict . "

beaches along egypt ’ s red sea coast closed on sunday while search teams looked for sharks . a 70-year-old woman died on sunday after being attacked by a shark while swimming near the shore in the red sea .
medical officials said the tourist was pulled out of the water dead after the shark mauled her thigh and arm .
the death in the popular resort of sharm el-sheikh comes after four people were injured in similar attacks at the resort earlier in the week .
following the first attacks the government closed beaches from wednesday until saturday .
on thursday , authorities said they captured two sharks believed to be behind the attacks .
the environment ministry has once again ordered beaches in sharm el-sheikh and the surrounding area to close for 72 hours while search teams scour the water for sharks .
very rare attacks the number of recent shark attacks is unusual for the sinai peninsula , which is a popular scuba diving destination .
" it has never happened before , " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana told the news agency afp .
" we are getting marine biologists from abroad to assess the situation and why there was this change in biological nature , " said garana .
manager of the sinai diver 's centre , rolf schmid said the whole area had not had sharks " for the past 10 to 15 years . "

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 06.12.2010 scientists move a step closer to unpacking antimatter großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible face of matter and antimatter scientists at the european nuclear research center -lrb- cern -rrb- in geneva have gotten closer to creating an antimatter beam , the farthest along in unlocking the secrets of this mystifying material . antimatter has defied scientific comprehension ever since its existence was predicted by the british physicist paul dirac back in 1928 .
but in a paper published today in the journal physical review letters , yasunori yamazaki , a cern antimatter researcher , said his experiment had succeeded in creating a significant number of antihydrogen atoms in flight , a development which will ultimately help him and his team understand the enigmas of antimatter .
at the time of the big bang , approximately 15 billion years ago , equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been created , but the latter appears to have disappeared , and to look into the universe is to see nothing but former .
the theoretical explanation for that imbalance is that in the first seconds of the universe the number of matter particles very fractionally outnumbered that of antimatter , and that when the two made contact and rapidly began to annihilate each other , the only thing that survived was the excess matter .
that being the case , scientists have never been able to get a handle on antimatter .
but they are working hard to fill that gap .
one way of doing so is to take a hydrogen atom , which consists of one proton and one electron , and see whether its antimatter counterpart , antihydrogen , which is made up of an antiproton and a positron , shares its behavioral properties .
if they were able to detect differences between the two , researchers would have some insight into what happened at the very beginning of life as we have come to know it .
" by solving this question , " yamazaki said in an interview with deutsche welle , " we would have a basis of our existence . "
in for the long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at work at cern this new discovery comes approximately two weeks after the same cern team announced that they had trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms .
the cern scientists have spent the past five years working on ways of creating antihydrogen atoms to be kept away from ordinary matter in order to study its behavioral properties .
they produced the antihydrogen atoms by using what is known as a cusp trap to bring a combination of magnetic fields and antiprotons together and subsequently channeled the atoms along a vacuum pipe where they can be studied in flight .
although the technique is still a long way from providing the world with an insight into the whereabouts of antimatter , yamazaki said the method of producing and eventually studying antihydrogen means it is only a question of time before the secrets of antimatter are unlocked .
symmetry versus non-symmetry to get there , he and his team are trying to understand the charge , parity and time -lrb- cpt -rrb- symmetry between matter and antimatter .
at the moment the symmetry is believed to exist , but the physicists are planning to do high precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen to gain greater knowledge .
bildunterschrift : the world 's largest particle physics laboratory as seen from above " if our experiment reveals non-conservation of the cpt symmetry in some way , it would be a really revolutionary discovery , " yamazaki said .
" i am very much looking forward to getting some information on the cpr symmetry and the mystery of the non-existence of antimatter in our universe . "
he says the first simple spectroscopy could take place as early as next year , but that the more earnest spectroscopy which could reveal deviation of antihydrogen from hydrogen would take several years to get prepare .
a long way from practical use thomas lohse , particle physics at berlin 's humboldt university , welcomed the progress , which he said he hoped would answer some very specific questions .
" if the antihydrogen atom is the same as the hydrogen one , does the light have the same frequency ? " he mused .
" another interesting issue is whether antihydrogen would fall to the floor or float upwards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if herz 's discovery can spawn our electronic age , what might come next ?
he believes it could take decades before scientists truly understand the properties of antimatter , and even longer before their findings are put to practical use .
but that is par for the course in the world of physics .
and to highlight the point , lohse cited gustav herz 's discovery that electromagnetism could produce electromagnetic waves .
" at the time people asked what it was good for , but without electromagnetic waves we would not have satellites , radios , televisions , modern communication , " lohse told deutsche welle .
" it is possible that there will be an application for antimatter , but it is hard to predict . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.12.2010 developers around the world push for open data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developers at the open data hackathon plan new apps the international open data hackathon kicked off in berlin and more than 50 other cities worldwide on saturday .
developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

its themed rooms cover all kinds of food products , from biscuits to beer . neuwied , germany , is home to what is believed to be europe 's first supermarket-themed hotel .
thirty-six sponsors , including german household names like veltins beer and dr oetker foods , have collaborated with the german national food retailers association to help build the hotel and design rooms to attract food and drink fans .
in return for their investment , the companies , including international brands like coca-cola and unilever , are given the opportunity to present their own product ideas and corporate philosophies in the bedrooms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr oetker is one of 36 corporate sponsors each of the 47 sponsored rooms – the hotel has a total of 115 – is unique .
for instance , the room designed by the german snack food producer chio encourages particularly young guests to party on potato chips and other snacks in a room with a rotating mirror disco ball and music pumped in by an integrated sound system .
or take the room designed by german tea producer messmer : there 's no getting away from tea in this room , which is decorated with traditional tea crates and images of exotic tea plantations on the wall .
and yet another eye-catcher is the room created by ferrero , the company behind the popular nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread and a wide range of sweets .
the room recaptures the scene of a television commercial for its raffaello coconut candies set on a desert island , complete with palm trees and shells as well as photos of sandy beaches and books about travel destinations .
standard supermarket shelving the shelving in the rooms is standard supermarket equipment , which the german shop designer itab adapted for the hotel .
and while the hotel check-in desk has the look and feel of a store checkout point , guests can relax in the reception area in chairs that look like shopping carts .
the hotel includes a mini-supermarket , stocked with a variety of snacks , beverages and other foods that can be warmed in a microwave .
bildunterschrift : each of the 47 sponsored rooms has a unique design born of necessity the idea of opening a hotel focused on grocery store merchandise was actually born of necessity , according to hotel manager peter gruenhaeuser .
the german national food retailers association needed a modern facility to house trainees visiting its non-profit training center in neuwied , and also to put up retail executives attending its various conferences .
" we needed something more upscale , " hotel director peter gruenhaeuser told deutsche welle .
" so we 're now a four-star conference hotel , which is also open to the general public . "
plans for future expansion include the creation of a wellness center , which , gruenhaeuser says , will also feature a food theme .
a single room costs 90 euros and a suite 120 euros – and there 's plenty of food and drink for snack-lovers .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .

prior to the ceremony on friday in oslo , the chinese authorities have tightened their grip on dissidents . chinese artist ai weiwei was about to fly from china to south korea .
from there , he had to continue his journey to berlin , and then to denmark .
one hour prior to his departure from beijing international airport , ai weiwei was getting ready to board his airplane . he was waiting in the departure lounge when a police officer came in .
the police officer wanted to check his passport again , saying there had been some problems with his passport inspection .
" at that moment it became clear to me that they wanted to stop me from leaving the country " , said ai .

" the chinese government is outraged because the nobel committee has awarded the prize to liu xiaobo .
now , they have put hundreds of people on the exit control list . " numerous chinese dissidents , academics and lawyers , including liu xiaobo 's lawyer , were kept from travelling abroad last week .
apparently , chinese officials feared that he might also fly to oslo .
according to the chinese civil rights groups , several other dissidents were denied travel documents by the chinese government .
this includes sun wanguan , a university professor from shandong province in eastern china .
he had been invited by liu xia , the nobel laureate ’ s wife , to come to norway to attend the ceremony . cut off from any contact liu xiaobo is currently serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges .
his wife , who lives in beijing , is under strict house arrest and is completely cut off from any contact with the outside world .

foreign ministry spokeswomen jiang yu called the norwegian committee ’ s decision politically-motivated . " interference in china ’ s judicial sovereignty " " this year the nobel committee has given the peace prize to a convicted criminal .
he is currently in jail because he has broken chinese laws .
this is a proof of their overt support to the illegal activities in china – an outright provocation , and an interference in our judicial sovereignty , " said jiang . china , in return , has come under fire for its stance on liu .
former czech president vaclav havel and nobel peace prize winner desmond tutu urged beijing to free liu from jail , and his wife from house arrest . oslo is gearing up for the prestigious ceremony with neither the laureate nor any of his close associates attending .

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

the attack took place at a government-backed tribal meeting in mohmand agency . most of the dead included tribal leaders , policemen , and civilians .
among the dead are two local journalists who were covering the meeting for local television channels .
eyewitnesses have painted a picture of devastation and mayhem of the incident .
" there was a deafening sound and it caused a cloud of dust and smoke and a subsequent hue and cry , " forty-five year old qalandar khan was quoted by pakistan 's local media .
the injured have been rushed to the hospitals in peshawar .
according to mian iftikhar hussein , the information minister of khyber pakhtunkwa province , most of the injured are in a critical condition .
taliban stronghold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers walk through the rubble at the site of the bombing in ghalalnai the area bordering afghanistan is considered a stronghold of the taliban .
the aim of the tribal meeting was to discuss the formation of an anti-taliban militia .
there have been several anti-taliban militias in the region which are supported by the pakistani government in an attempt to fight the extremists with local support .
the pakistan army has launched several military operations to rid the area of the taliban and al-qaeda militants .
on the other side , the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan -lrb- ttp -rrb- has been carrying out attacks on security personnel and the tribal militias .
though no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , government officials are blaming it on the taliban .
the attack was carried out in a government compound of ghalalnai , the central town of mohmand agency , 175 km north-west of the capital islamabad .
two men disguised as policemen tried to sneak into the compound , where the tribal elders had gathered to formulate their strategy against the taliban , and detonated the bombs .
one of the bombers was intercepted at the gate of the compound ; however , he was still able to blow himself up .
according to the local news channels , the possible target of the attack could be mohmand agency 's top political agent amjad ali khan , who remained unhurt in the attack .
last month , a similar attack took place in a mosque in darra adam khel , killing at least 67 people .
according to the local sources , the mosque was frequented by the pro-government tribal leaders .
combating taliban with local support according to owais tohid , correspondent of christian science monitor in karachi , the ttp has been regularly attacking jirgas -lrb- assemblies of tribal leaders -rrb- in every tribal agency since 2007 .
he believes that the aim of the pakistani taliban behind targeting the tribal elders is to create a vacuum in which nobody could challenge their power .
" any dissent , any voice against them is obviously a threat for them , and they want to silence it , " tohid told deutsche welle .
but is the support of the pakistani government adequate to battle the militants ?
tohid believes that the support is both political and logistical , albeit the tribal leaders often complain that the government is not doing enough , and sufficient protection has not been provided to them by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of a local citizens ' militia waving his rifle in the bajaur tribal region " naturally , if you have such lethal attacks , you wo n't have any voice of dissent for some time , and that is the aim of the taliban .
we must not forget that last year the anti-taliban militias of mohmand agency were responsible for handing over maulvi omar to the authorities , who happened to be one of the main spokespersons of the ttp . "
owais tohid denies that the government approach could create a civil war-like situation and considers the support of the tribal leaders vital in the fight against militants .
however , several rights groups and peace activists have criticised the government ’ s strategy of arming the tribal leaders .
they are of the opinion that this would create a perpetual war-like situation in the region , and that the government should only support the local leaders politically .
on the other hand , the government has reiterated its commitment to the fight against terrorism .
" we are not scared of such attacks and will keep on taking these enemies of humanity to task until they disappear from society , " said mian iftikhar hussein .

nord stream pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work on the nord stream pipeline has already begun one of the main topics addressed during the talks was the nord stream gas pipeline , currently under construction in the baltic sea , which would connect russia 's natural gas supply to germany .
in poland , there have been concerns that the construction on the pipeline would hinder efforts to expand the polish port of swinoujscie , known as swinemuende in german .
swinoujscie would be poland 's point of access to the natural gas pipeline , and the expansion efforts are being made to equip the port town with necessary equipment to tap the pipeline .
while a solution is still being worked on , tusk said he was happy with the efforts of germany to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the problem .
" there has been progress and good intentions on the part of the germans , " he said in berlin . " there is no danger from the west that the reconstruction efforts of the port are in danger . "

wulff will make the trip on tuesday to mark the 40th anniversary of former german chancellor willy brandt 's symbolic gesture of kneeling before the warsaw uprising memorial on december 7 , 1970 .
brandt 's gesture symbolized german policies toward the east at the time and helped improve relations between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.12.2010 developers around the world push for open data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developers at the open data hackathon plan new apps the international open data hackathon kicked off in berlin and more than 50 other cities worldwide on saturday .
developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

but in a paper published today in the journal physical review letters , yasunori yamazaki , a cern antimatter researcher , said his experiment had succeeded in creating a significant number of antihydrogen atoms in flight , a development which will ultimately help him and his team understand the enigmas of antimatter .
at the time of the big bang , approximately 15 billion years ago , equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been created , but the latter appears to have disappeared , and to look into the universe is to see nothing but former .
the theoretical explanation for that imbalance is that in the first seconds of the universe the number of matter particles very fractionally outnumbered that of antimatter , and that when the two made contact and rapidly began to annihilate each other , the only thing that survived was the excess matter .
that being the case , scientists have never been able to get a handle on antimatter .
but they are working hard to fill that gap .
one way of doing so is to take a hydrogen atom , which consists of one proton and one electron , and see whether its antimatter counterpart , antihydrogen , which is made up of an antiproton and a positron , shares its behavioral properties .
if they were able to detect differences between the two , researchers would have some insight into what happened at the very beginning of life as we have come to know it .
" by solving this question , " yamazaki said in an interview with deutsche welle , " we would have a basis of our existence . "
in for the long haul bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists at work at cern this new discovery comes approximately two weeks after the same cern team announced that they had trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms .
the cern scientists have spent the past five years working on ways of creating antihydrogen atoms to be kept away from ordinary matter in order to study its behavioral properties .
they produced the antihydrogen atoms by using what is known as a cusp trap to bring a combination of magnetic fields and antiprotons together and subsequently channeled the atoms along a vacuum pipe where they can be studied in flight .
although the technique is still a long way from providing the world with an insight into the whereabouts of antimatter , yamazaki said the method of producing and eventually studying antihydrogen means it is only a question of time before the secrets of antimatter are unlocked .
symmetry versus non-symmetry to get there , he and his team are trying to understand the charge , parity and time -lrb- cpt -rrb- symmetry between matter and antimatter .
at the moment the symmetry is believed to exist , but the physicists are planning to do high precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen to gain greater knowledge .
bildunterschrift : the world 's largest particle physics laboratory as seen from above " if our experiment reveals non-conservation of the cpt symmetry in some way , it would be a really revolutionary discovery , " yamazaki said .
" i am very much looking forward to getting some information on the cpr symmetry and the mystery of the non-existence of antimatter in our universe . "
he says the first simple spectroscopy could take place as early as next year , but that the more earnest spectroscopy which could reveal deviation of antihydrogen from hydrogen would take several years to get prepare .
a long way from practical use thomas lohse , particle physics at berlin 's humboldt university , welcomed the progress , which he said he hoped would answer some very specific questions .
" if the antihydrogen atom is the same as the hydrogen one , does the light have the same frequency ? " he mused .
" another interesting issue is whether antihydrogen would fall to the floor or float upwards . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if herz 's discovery can spawn our electronic age , what might come next ?
he believes it could take decades before scientists truly understand the properties of antimatter , and even longer before their findings are put to practical use .
but that is par for the course in the world of physics .
and to highlight the point , lohse cited gustav herz 's discovery that electromagnetism could produce electromagnetic waves .
" at the time people asked what it was good for , but without electromagnetic waves we would not have satellites , radios , televisions , modern communication , " lohse told deutsche welle .
" it is possible that there will be an application for antimatter , but it is hard to predict . "

beaches along egypt ’ s red sea coast closed on sunday while search teams looked for sharks . a 70-year-old woman died on sunday after being attacked by a shark while swimming near the shore in the red sea .
medical officials said the tourist was pulled out of the water dead after the shark mauled her thigh and arm .
the death in the popular resort of sharm el-sheikh comes after four people were injured in similar attacks at the resort earlier in the week .
following the first attacks the government closed beaches from wednesday until saturday .
on thursday , authorities said they captured two sharks believed to be behind the attacks .
the environment ministry has once again ordered beaches in sharm el-sheikh and the surrounding area to close for 72 hours while search teams scour the water for sharks .
very rare attacks the number of recent shark attacks is unusual for the sinai peninsula , which is a popular scuba diving destination .
" it has never happened before , " egyptian tourism minister zuhair garana told the news agency afp .
" we are getting marine biologists from abroad to assess the situation and why there was this change in biological nature , " said garana .
manager of the sinai diver 's centre , rolf schmid said the whole area had not had sharks " for the past 10 to 15 years . "

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .
greece briefly halted the sending of mail and parcels abroad after a package addressed to merkel arrived at the chancellery office in berlin .
another package , addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , was discovered on board a plane at bologna airport .

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .

developers around the world want to use public data to build better websites and mobile phone apps . on saturday , software developers worldwide from nairobi to buenos aires took part in the international open data hackathon .
using public data , participants were tasked with building apps which they thought might improve life in their cities .
in berlin , designers and developers gathered at your neighbours , a digital studio that has thrown its support behind the open data movement .
edial dekker , the studio 's manager , and the hackathon participants share a binding belief : in order for a democratic society to function , citizens need to know what their government is doing .
an essential part of that , they say , is open access to government data and information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants are asked to build apps that would improve their cities " it creates transparency .
that means people get involved in decision-making , build stuff around government services that make things better , " he said .
moreover , he says government data is a public good .
" when you 're a citizen , you pay your taxes , " dekker explained .
" you also pay for the registration of this data .
it makes sense that you have access to it . "
in germany , raw data about schools , crime and health is often difficult to access .
the government releases reports , but rarely makes the unadulterated source data available .
the data which is free is often locked up in pdf or closed standard formats , which are n't possible to reuse .
dekker says the hackathon is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that freeing the data is in everyone 's interest .
" we try to make stuff and show the government this can be done if you open up the data , " he said .
" it 's very common for people to sit behind a computer and create new apps and services just because they can and want to improve services . "
current open data applications largely from canada , us , uk that 's exactly why friedrich lindenberg participated in the hackathon - he wants to use open data to help germans better understand how their tax money is being spent .
" i was inspired by wheredoesmymoneygo.org , which is a british site .
it makes more transparent which part of my taxes go to which function of government , " he explained .
there are many other examples of open government websites in the united states , like nextbus.com in san francisco , which tells mobile phone users when the next bus will arrive .
just across the bay , oakland.crimespotting.org displays the city 's crime data in an easy-to-understand format by overlaying it on digital maps .
in canada , openparliament.ca keeps track of how members of parliament vote on bills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sifting through open data can be a daunting prospect but lindenberg also pointed out that open data is n't just helpful for big projects .
" there are a lot of little apps too , like where is the next public toilet ? " he said .
" where 's next cab stop ?
these small ones help improve everyday life . "
beyond visionary developers , some public officials also support this concept .
" i think it 's a good idea , " said wolfgang both , an economist with the city of berlin 's department of economics and technology , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it gives more transparency and opens procedures to the people .
it also helps the industry to develop new services .
it 's both a step to more freedom in our society and to more business and development in europe . "
privacy concerns remain but while many have applauded the government 's willingness to open itself to the full weight of public scrutiny , others have concerns about individual privacy .
both explained that while open data is supposed to be anonymous , " from time to time , you are really able to connect open data with personal data . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with open data , there are still privacy concerns as a result , that 's left berlin officials in a tight spot - filtering all the data before it is released promises to be both expensive and time-consuming .
digital activists argue the files need to be freed quickly in order to preserve their value .
meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .
data on city planning , the environment and water quality topped the wish list .
but the open data movement is n't just about access .
once it is released , few people know what to do with raw data .
" germans really make stuff very complicated , " said michael kreil , a developer who is using budget data to create easy-to-understand visual guides that make this data easier to understand .
" especially the data about government spending .
it 's 2,500 pages thick .
no one can understand it .
even politicians come and say thank you for the visualization , because we do n't understand it ourselves . "

meanwhile , both launched a citywide survey to find out what data consumers in berlin want access to first .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .
greece briefly halted the sending of mail and parcels abroad after a package addressed to merkel arrived at the chancellery office in berlin .
another package , addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , was discovered on board a plane at bologna airport .

the attack took place at a government-backed tribal meeting in mohmand agency . most of the dead included tribal leaders , policemen , and civilians .
among the dead are two local journalists who were covering the meeting for local television channels .
eyewitnesses have painted a picture of devastation and mayhem of the incident .
" there was a deafening sound and it caused a cloud of dust and smoke and a subsequent hue and cry , " forty-five year old qalandar khan was quoted by pakistan 's local media .
the injured have been rushed to the hospitals in peshawar .
according to mian iftikhar hussein , the information minister of khyber pakhtunkwa province , most of the injured are in a critical condition .
taliban stronghold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers walk through the rubble at the site of the bombing in ghalalnai the area bordering afghanistan is considered a stronghold of the taliban .
the aim of the tribal meeting was to discuss the formation of an anti-taliban militia .
there have been several anti-taliban militias in the region which are supported by the pakistani government in an attempt to fight the extremists with local support .
the pakistan army has launched several military operations to rid the area of the taliban and al-qaeda militants .
on the other side , the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan -lrb- ttp -rrb- has been carrying out attacks on security personnel and the tribal militias .
though no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , government officials are blaming it on the taliban .
the attack was carried out in a government compound of ghalalnai , the central town of mohmand agency , 175 km north-west of the capital islamabad .
two men disguised as policemen tried to sneak into the compound , where the tribal elders had gathered to formulate their strategy against the taliban , and detonated the bombs .
one of the bombers was intercepted at the gate of the compound ; however , he was still able to blow himself up .
according to the local news channels , the possible target of the attack could be mohmand agency 's top political agent amjad ali khan , who remained unhurt in the attack .
last month , a similar attack took place in a mosque in darra adam khel , killing at least 67 people .
according to the local sources , the mosque was frequented by the pro-government tribal leaders .
combating taliban with local support according to owais tohid , correspondent of christian science monitor in karachi , the ttp has been regularly attacking jirgas -lrb- assemblies of tribal leaders -rrb- in every tribal agency since 2007 .
he believes that the aim of the pakistani taliban behind targeting the tribal elders is to create a vacuum in which nobody could challenge their power .
" any dissent , any voice against them is obviously a threat for them , and they want to silence it , " tohid told deutsche welle .
but is the support of the pakistani government adequate to battle the militants ?
tohid believes that the support is both political and logistical , albeit the tribal leaders often complain that the government is not doing enough , and sufficient protection has not been provided to them by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of a local citizens ' militia waving his rifle in the bajaur tribal region " naturally , if you have such lethal attacks , you wo n't have any voice of dissent for some time , and that is the aim of the taliban .
we must not forget that last year the anti-taliban militias of mohmand agency were responsible for handing over maulvi omar to the authorities , who happened to be one of the main spokespersons of the ttp . "
owais tohid denies that the government approach could create a civil war-like situation and considers the support of the tribal leaders vital in the fight against militants .
however , several rights groups and peace activists have criticised the government ’ s strategy of arming the tribal leaders .
they are of the opinion that this would create a perpetual war-like situation in the region , and that the government should only support the local leaders politically .
on the other hand , the government has reiterated its commitment to the fight against terrorism .
" we are not scared of such attacks and will keep on taking these enemies of humanity to task until they disappear from society , " said mian iftikhar hussein .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

two suspects were wanted for connections with a group that sent parcel bombs to european leaders last month . greek police arrested six people on suspicion of having links with terrorism after a series of raids across the country .
the five men and a woman , aged between 21 and 30 , were detained after police uncovered a haul of weapons , police chief lefteris oikonomou told a press briefing on sunday .
two of the individuals arrested were wanted for alleged connections with the left-wing group conspiracy of fire nuclei .
the organization is believed to be responsible for a series of parcel bombs sent to international embassies and european leaders , including chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , last month .
the first two suspects were detained on saturday after officers found three kalashnikov assault rifles , semi-automatic guns , handguns , grenades and explosives - along with stolen car license plates , face hoods and wigs - in a basement garage just outside athens .
further arrests were later made around athens , the central town of agrinio and on the island of crete .

however , early ballistics tests revealed no link with extremist activity .
sect surfaced after shooting of teenager the sect of revolutionaries first came to notice after serious rioting in greece following the death of teenager alexis grigoropoulos , who was hit by a police bullet in december 2008 .
greece has a long history of domestic terrorism , with more than 40 people killed in attacks in the last three decades .
greece briefly halted the sending of mail and parcels abroad after a package addressed to merkel arrived at the chancellery office in berlin .
another package , addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , was discovered on board a plane at bologna airport .

yet two significant victories are within reach – provided an impasse over kyoto can be resolved . no one expects a new framework agreement to tackle greenhouse gas emissions to emerge this year .
however , two crucial elements of such a treaty are within reach as the cancun climate talks enter their " high level " phase this week .
forestry and finance may yet distinguish the summit as a success of sorts .
deals on both seem possible as environment ministers prepare to take over the negotiations of their delegates this tuesday , but much hinges on a dispute which erupted last week .
" after one week it has become clear that cancun offers two possibilities : the complete burial of the kyoto protocol on the one hand , or the basis of a future agreement next year in south africa , " greenpeace climate coordinator martin kaiser told deutsche welle .
kyoto in the air bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deals on forestry and finance could be reached in cancun the kyoto protocol is a totem issue for developing countries , and many – especially china – are going into the second week of talks determined to see its renewal .
china 's lead negotiator , su wei , told the country 's xinhua news agency that there was " no room for compromise on principles , " in an interview on sunday .
japan exposed a chasm in the talks when it entered negotiations last week saying that it had no intention to commit to a second period of kyoto after its first period expires in 2012 .
japanese negotiator hideki minamikawa said it did " not make sense " to continue with the current system , as it only imposes obligations on a small number of countries .
the kyoto protocol , agreed in 1997 , is the only legally-binding treaty to date to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for heating the planet .
recognising the developed world 's historic contribution to the problem , it distinguishes between differing obligations for rich and poor , requiring industrialised countries to cut their emissions by an average of five percent on 1990 levels in the first period .
the trouble is it applies to less than a third of man-made emissions and does n't cover the world 's top two polluters : china , a developing country , is not legally obliged to make cuts and the united states is not a party .
the european union , which has the most ambitious climate agenda in the industrialised world , is between japan and china on the issue .
it says it supports kyoto , but it wants to gain concessions from major developing countries , such as clear commitments to emissions reductions and independent verification of these kinds of actions .
other countries including russia , canada and australia appear to be keeping their cards close to their chests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far the deals made in copenhagen have not been watered down money in the bank ?
which is to say that progress on some of the most significant developments to come out of last year 's disappointing meeting in copenhagen hangs in the balance .
" the negotiations are extremely fluid at the moment , " nick nuttall , spokesperson for the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing that has really been gained in the first week but perhaps there is also nothing being lost .
the pledges that were made in copenhagen remain , they have n't been watered down , nobody has cancelled them , but the main challenge right now as we head into the second week is how to anchor these pledges so they are secured . "
one of the copenhagen accord 's most impressive achievements was the promise to raise $ 100 billion -lrb- 75 billion euros -rrb- a year for developing countries as of 2020 .
the money is designed to help pay for the costs of responding to climate change – everything from flood prevention to relocation to developing new crop varieties .
rich countries ' willingness to name a figure in the ballpark needed by the developing world was a major step forward in the negotiating process , because it is recognised that money is vital for unlocking other areas of the talks , including poorer countries ' acceptance of emissions targets or independent monitoring of their actions .
with progress on the figures for climate finance all but consolidated , remaining differences could be overcome this week .
these include determining which parties gain ultimate control of the money as well as how much should be publicly backed , and how much should be privately raised .
seeing redd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries rich in forestation could be compensated for reducing logging the other area of the talks which could yet prove successful involves securing a deal to compensate forest-rich developing countries in return for foregoing logging .
deforestation is believed to account for around 17 percent of human-induced emissions , around about as much as the transport sector globally .
the rainforest alliance , a non-government organisation , estimates the cost of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 at around $ 25 – $ 30 billion per year .
though this sounds like a lot of money , spent globally it could be one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting the planet 's emissions in the short term .
while there is a broad consensus in support of establishing a mechanism for rewarding forest preservation , here too the devil is in the detail .
making conservation lucrative can open conflicting interests with miners , loggers and agri-businesses , and how to account for emissions savings is also a tricky business , with loopholes potentially allowing for pollution increases disguised as decreases .
on the issue of emissions targets more broadly , there is little hope of seeing anything more ambitious than was presented in last year 's copenhagen accord .
a unep report ahead of cancun found that the accord 's combined voluntary emissions reductions still only amounted to 60 percent of what scientists say would provide a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to two degrees celsius .
on the bright side , it does n't look like countries are backtracking on these pledges either .

but forest fires in israel may have restarted communication . last may 's killing of nine turkish citizens by israeli security forces as they seized a ship trying to break its embargo on gaza saw bilateral relations collapse amid bitter mutual recriminations .
but the fatal forest fire that struck israel last week may have become an opportunity for thawing relations between tel aviv and ankara . in a surprise move , turkey sent two firefighting planes to israel to help contain the deadly blaze .
following ankara 's decision to send the planes to israel , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu placed a telephone call to his turkish counterpart to thank him .
this was the first conversation the two leaders have had since the deadly incident last may .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also used an address to his supporters over the weekend to tentatively reach out to israel " some say we should turn a new page … an apology must be offered first , compensation must be paid first , " erdogan said .
" if a hand is extended , we will not leave it in the air , but we want to see that this hand is extended with sincerity . "
closed-door talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sent planes to help fight the fire in israel the apparent softening of his stance has also been matched by a diplomatic move .
over the weekend there was a high-level meeting of turkish and israeli diplomats in geneva , although no details of the talks were released .
this comes at a time when ankara is facing mounting pressure from its allies to mend fences with israel .
last month the head of the us senate foreign relations committee , john kerry , met with erdogan .
" it is in the interests of everyone - turks , israelis americans and others - that the relationship , an important one between turkey and israel , be renewed , " kerry said .
that stance has been echoed in europe .
in october , german president christian wulff used his visit to turkey to stress the importance of turkish-israel relations .
the european union has also called on ankara to improve ties , and observers say ankara is also facing growing pressure on the issue from middle eastern leaders .
until the collapse in bilateral relations , turkey had been playing a key role as a mediator in peace talks between israel and the palestinians .
but political scientist cengiz aktar says the collapse in relations with israel has significantly curtailed turkey 's regional influence .
" these peace and mediation efforts are dead .
so turkey 's stance around the world can not survive by antagonizing israel , " said aktar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan may be softening his stance on israel diplomatic challenge the turkish-israeli tensions are seen as just another destabilizing factor in already unstable region .
but while pressure is mounting on ankara to resolve its differences , analysts say to do so will require a good deal of diplomatic skill .
" the government has engaged itself very concretely on these topics and would not want to give the impression of stepping down at this moment , " diplomatic correspondent semih idiz told deutsche welle .
" this would cost the government domestically in the political environment that we have in the country at the moment .
so we have a bit of stalemate in which turkey is expected to take steps but is not in a position to do so because of domestic politics . "
with a general election scheduled for next june , domestic policy is of heightened importance .
while the populist anti-israel stance that erdogan espoused until the past few days may win him some votes , this comes at a high cost for turkey 's international reputation .

at a joint press conference , india 's prime minister manmohan singh said , " a framework agreement has been signed between areva and our national thermal corporation .
there are issues with regard to the other technical matters including prices .
these are subject matters of negotiations . "
in his response , sarkozy said the agreements would be concluded quickly .
" we will ensure and do our utmost to ensure that this is done as speedily as possible .
this agreement also includes the price of energy for our indian friends and we will respect usual processes and procedures in india . there are no hidden surprises . "

at a joint press conference , india 's prime minister manmohan singh said , " a framework agreement has been signed between areva and our national thermal corporation .
there are issues with regard to the other technical matters including prices .
these are subject matters of negotiations . "
in his response , sarkozy said the agreements would be concluded quickly .
" we will ensure and do our utmost to ensure that this is done as speedily as possible .
this agreement also includes the price of energy for our indian friends and we will respect usual processes and procedures in india . there are no hidden surprises . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.12.2010 run on winter tires creates german shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winter tires are in hot demand in cold and icy germany wanted : new winter tires in germany .
the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 06.12.2010 forest fire thaws turkish and israeli cold shoulders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between turkey and israel may be starting to mend when turkish citizens in an aid flotilla to gaza were killed by israeli security forces in may , relations between the two countries hit a low point .
but forest fires in israel may have restarted communication . last may 's killing of nine turkish citizens by israeli security forces as they seized a ship trying to break its embargo on gaza saw bilateral relations collapse amid bitter mutual recriminations .
but the fatal forest fire that struck israel last week may have become an opportunity for thawing relations between tel aviv and ankara . in a surprise move , turkey sent two firefighting planes to israel to help contain the deadly blaze .
following ankara 's decision to send the planes to israel , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu placed a telephone call to his turkish counterpart to thank him .
this was the first conversation the two leaders have had since the deadly incident last may .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also used an address to his supporters over the weekend to tentatively reach out to israel " some say we should turn a new page … an apology must be offered first , compensation must be paid first , " erdogan said .
" if a hand is extended , we will not leave it in the air , but we want to see that this hand is extended with sincerity . "
closed-door talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey sent planes to help fight the fire in israel the apparent softening of his stance has also been matched by a diplomatic move .
over the weekend there was a high-level meeting of turkish and israeli diplomats in geneva , although no details of the talks were released .
this comes at a time when ankara is facing mounting pressure from its allies to mend fences with israel .
last month the head of the us senate foreign relations committee , john kerry , met with erdogan .
" it is in the interests of everyone - turks , israelis americans and others - that the relationship , an important one between turkey and israel , be renewed , " kerry said .
that stance has been echoed in europe .
in october , german president christian wulff used his visit to turkey to stress the importance of turkish-israel relations .
the european union has also called on ankara to improve ties , and observers say ankara is also facing growing pressure on the issue from middle eastern leaders .
until the collapse in bilateral relations , turkey had been playing a key role as a mediator in peace talks between israel and the palestinians .
but political scientist cengiz aktar says the collapse in relations with israel has significantly curtailed turkey 's regional influence .
" these peace and mediation efforts are dead .
so turkey 's stance around the world can not survive by antagonizing israel , " said aktar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan may be softening his stance on israel diplomatic challenge the turkish-israeli tensions are seen as just another destabilizing factor in already unstable region .
but while pressure is mounting on ankara to resolve its differences , analysts say to do so will require a good deal of diplomatic skill .
" the government has engaged itself very concretely on these topics and would not want to give the impression of stepping down at this moment , " diplomatic correspondent semih idiz told deutsche welle .
" this would cost the government domestically in the political environment that we have in the country at the moment .
so we have a bit of stalemate in which turkey is expected to take steps but is not in a position to do so because of domestic politics . "
with a general election scheduled for next june , domestic policy is of heightened importance .
while the populist anti-israel stance that erdogan espoused until the past few days may win him some votes , this comes at a high cost for turkey 's international reputation .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

but the recent wikileaks document release could lead to a backlash and a new emphasis on secrecy . since 9/11 the buzzword for governments around the world cooperating with each other , but also for national agencies working together , was data sharing .
that was considered one of the major lessons of the terrorist attacks of 2001 : the various governments and government agencies around the world which collect various pieces of information , need to share and evaluate all their available data together to get a full picture of upcoming threats or unfolding events .
that assessment , that when push comes to shove , information sharing is more important than the risk of misuse by information being distributed too widely was a key reason for the complete overhaul of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the us as well as in many other countries . in the wake of the current wikileaks data deluge , however , that basic tenet of transparency and information sharing could come under threat .
" no doubt you 'll see some backlash , " kurt volker , a former us ambassador to nato and currently managing director at the center for transatlantic relations at johns hopkins university in washington , told deutsche welle .
" people will look at this and say we have to do a better job protecting secret information in order to have access to information . "
chilling effect already governments have announced that they will evaluate and improve how they gather , share and store important information .
in the us , for instance , that will mean that the number of people who have access to information will be slashed considerably .
bildunterschrift : electronic data can never be entirely safe what 's more , international officials , politicians and business leaders will also be more careful in what they divulge to their us counterparts , says volker , who calls this a chilling effect for us diplomacy .
so could we face a situation again where the urge for secrecy and compartmentalization of information trumps transparency and thereby hampers the international fight against terrorism and organized crime ?
" i think that that would be an overreaction frankly , " says volker .
" i think that we need to be able to access and use information wisely and the trick is going to be to provide greater confidence that it 's going to be kept secure . "
no complete data security while there certainly will be efforts to further curtail the dissemination of information and to improve the safety of sensitive data , there is a limit to what can be achieved . " we know that electronic data are never as secure as data put on paper , " jeanette hofmann , an internet analyst at the social science research center berlin who also serves as an expert with the internet commission of the german parliament , told deutsche welle .
" it is never 100 percent secure , because it always relies on encryption and encryption can be decrypted . "
but reverting back to more face-to-face or phone conversations instead of writing everything down and mailing it around as some people have suggested is not feasible either .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict between whistleblowers and goverments will persist " i think phone conversations probably suffer from similar problems because as more and more networks are switched to internet transmission we face similar problems , " says hofmann .
no alternative to electronic communication in addition , it is simply not possible to eschew electronic communication despite its obvious drawbacks , adds volker : " because the advantage that you get from the use of the internet and electronic communication is speed , " he says .
" the disadvantage is that it is much harder to protect information .
but if you go for 100 percent protection by going back to paper copies or face-to-face meetings you lose considerable speed . "
for the experts , that means that the struggle over information between governments and whistleblowers will continue - despite all short-term efforts to better secure sensitive data and regardless of whether wikileaks itself will be around in the future .

it 's not racist , they say , it 's a harmless and much-loved tradition . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "
do n't they have anything more constructive to do with their lives ?
merry christmas and happy new year ! - eddie , us why ca n't people just leave traditions alone ! it is pretty sad that even here we are no longer allowed to say merry christmas for it now has to be happy holidays .
i think people should really find other things to fill their time with than to take away traditions .
i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .
thirdly , children understand so much better what the real meaning is .
so , do your homework and then try to make sense of this festival . - karin , the netherlands political correctness gone mad , as usual .
the role the zwarte piet plays in today 's holland is very positive : a loyal helper of santa 's , communicates with the children , is always happy - what 's wrong with that ?
so , he is black - and no longer a slave .
there are always some stupid people who want to change everything that is n't broken .
so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?
the british and american santa has helpers who are midgets - should they change because it makes people who do n't grow very tall look bad ?
i say those who criticize the dutch tradition and their nice zwarte pieten should get a life and stop trying to sanitize everything beyond belief . - dorotheen , great britain compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition children across europe eagerly await the arrive of st. nicholas on december 6 .
but in holland , the tradition has racist implications that the dutch are n't quite willing to give up .

racism controversy dampens holland 's sinterklaas tradition i guess political correctness has become the norm in your magazine .
i am a hispanic person with not-so-fair skin and i am aware of countries all over the world having traditions where foreigners are depicted badly .
however i see that as a tradition and not the way dutch people behave towards people with other national backgrounds .
on the contrary they are champions in helping foreign countries .
could you provide us with good news about christmas instead of poisoning the christmas spirit ? - jose , us i realize that from a foreign perspective the sinterklaas tradition can look very racist .
but in reality this is not the case .
children are taught that sinterklaas brings gifts to all the children in the netherlands .
but to accomplish this he needs the help of his zwarte pieten .
they are not seen as slaves but rather as helpers of sinterklaas and it is a very respectable job .
children would probably protest if there was a white zwarte piet .
zwarte pieten are associated with gifts and certain sweets -lrb- which we call pepernoten . -rrb-
they are friendly people who have the most awesome job in the world -lrb- working for sinterklaas . -rrb-
it is true that in some songs zwarte piet will give you a bag of salt , a beating with a bunch of sticks or may even take you to spain when you do not behave .
but this is always in a comical fashion .
everybody gets gifts and nobody gets punished for " being bad . "
in summary , zwarte pieten are not associated with a certain ethnic group .
they are a standalone entity . - richard , the netherlands leave well enough alone !
what 's next ?
make changes to " huckleberry finn ? "
sometimes political correctness goes too far . - perry , canada i 'm sorry but i really dislike the tone of your article about sinterklaas .
it is the perception of other countries and people who do n't know the tradition that it is racism that zwarte piet is black .
the current idea in the netherlands is that zwarte piet just happens to be black .
in my opinion it would be more an act of racism to paint him white because then you send out the totally wrong message that it is n't correct to celebrate a party with black people ! - bas , the netherlands i think this is foolish .
this racial stuff is really getting sickening .
nobody is degrading the black people .
this is just a tradition that goes back many years .
some of these opponents should " get a life ! "

i celebrate sinterklaas here in ontario and reading these articles upset me .
i just want to have our traditions and sayings the way they are !
so in other words , if you come to our countries for a better life then do so , but do n't try to change our country and our traditions to better suit you ! - danielle , canada zwarte piet is black because he used to enter the houses through the chimney in order to deliver the presents to the kids .
the kids put their shoe in front of the fireplace and usually put something to eat in it for the horse of sinterklaas - straw , or a carrot .
later the afro cut of the hair was added to it .
that has to change but as for the ' blackness ' of zwarte piet it is utter nonsense to call it racism . - pieter , the netherlands before you even think about taking this festival into racism , you ought to dip into history .
first of all , there is a lot of symbolism to this festival .
secondly , sinterklaas existed before racism even existed .

so the dutch santa has helpers who are black , so what ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 06.12.2010 bayern end their decade of dominance on a somewhat sour note großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , here in white , have been a step slow all season a league title every other year would be enough for most clubs , but not for bayern munich .
bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 06.12.2010 eu divided over euro bonds , no increase in bailout funds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurogroup head juncker has called for joint euro bonds there was no agreement on plans for joint euro bonds at a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers in brussels on monday , where the eurogroup decided against any increase in the rescue fund for debt-saddled countries . european ministers took no new steps on extending a eurozone emergency fund on monday after member states failed to reach agreement on the necessary steps to be taken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu treaty does not allow for euro bonds a five-hour meeting of financial ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro concluded that the existing fund was sufficient .
there were no official talks on proposals for the introduction of european bonds for sovereign lending , as an alternative to those on individual nations . " we do n't have any new decision to announce to you , " jean-claude juncker , the chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
luxembourg premier juncker and italian finance minister giulio tremonti had raised a new call for the european bonds ahead of the monthly meeting in brussels .
" europe must formulate a strong and systemic response to the crisis ...
this can be achieved by launching e-bonds , or european sovereign bonds , " juncker , the head of the committee of eurozone finance ministers , and tremonti wrote in the financial times on monday .
merkel talks of need for incentives however , chancellor angela merkel was quick to rebuff the call , saying the eu treaty did not allow for issuing common bonds .
also , she said , joint bonds would reduce competition and the interest rate incentive for fiscal good behavior .
" interest rates are an incentive to become better and meet the requirements of the stability and growth pact , " merkel added .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who on monday was named europe 's top finance minister by the financial times , said creating euro bonds would require " fundamental changes " in the eu treaty , something which is politically immensely difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the rescue plan for ireland , there are fears that other nations may need help the idea of a bond issued by the eurozone has been circulating since the euro itself was created .
until now , each country issues its own bonds .
pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

pressure to raise eurozone fund dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , was set to call on finance ministers to increase the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- bailout fund and urged the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to step up its purchases of bonds to stem the crisis .
germany , however , has rejected the call .
" i currently see no need to increase the fund , " merkel said on monday , adding that " a very small percentage " of the fund was needed for ireland 's recent bailout .
last week , ireland was offered 85 billion euros from europe 's bailout fund , a rescue mechanism set up after greece 's crisis earlier this year .
analysts warn that portugal , spain or italy could be the next eurozone states in need of assistance .
the possibility of extending the period in which greece must pay back its 110-billion-euro loan , to a longer timescale as agreed for ireland , has also been raised .
euro break-up on the cards ?
the market pressure on eurozone sovereign debt has given rise to speculation , mostly in britain and the united states , that the single currency might break up or that weaker states would be forced to abandon it .
but this move is highly unlikely due to the intertwined nature of the eurozone states , said ewald nowotny , a member of the ecb governing council .
" europe has already grown together so much that an amputation would have massive disadvantages for both sides , " he added .
spanish economy minister elena salgado said increasing the eurozone rescue fund was " not the question at the moment . "
according to salgado , spain 's economic fundamentals were sound and the country would not ask for financial support .
spain so far has raised its tobacco tax , cut down on subsidies for wind power and on friday approved privatization plans .
portugal , considered the next euro state at risk of a bailout , has resisted any new measures on top of a tough 2011 budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic is not too keen on introducing the euro czechs in no hurry to introduce euro meanwhile , czech prime minister petr necas has said he would not hurry to join the eurozone .
" my government will not fix a date for the adoption of the euro , " he said .
it would be " a political and economic blunder " to adopt europe 's currency at the moment .
necas has no plans to introduce the euro during his government 's current term which ends in 2014 .
" nobody can force us to adopt the euro , " he added .
the czech republic joined the eu in may 2004 , but most of its citizens oppose the single currency .
schaeuble has warned that the risk of an anti-euro political party emerging in germany should be taken seriously .
since the bailout for heavily indebted greece , the euro has become unpopular among germans .
but schaeuble said there is no reason to abandon the currency .
" without the euro the labor market would look much worse .
the euro brought us through the crisis well , " schaeuble said .
he also rejected a two-tiered eurozone of more stable and less stable states .
" that would be infinitely more expensive than everything we 're now doing for the euro , " he said .
an eu summit is scheduled for next week where eu leaders are expected to agree on a permanent eurozone rescue mechanism .
the current fund expires in 2013 .

bayern are heading toward another caesura and have yet to decide what life will be like after uli hoeness . the bundesliga title is a goal too far , bayern 's players acknowledged after this saturday 's unlucky loss to schalke .
barring a miracle comeback , which would also assume a disastrous collapse by leaders borussia dortmund , 2010-11 will mark the third time on the trot that bayern have failed to defend a bundesliga crown .
bayern 's focus will now be on qualifying for the next champions league season , a must since the 2012 final will be held at their home ground , the allianz arena in munich .
bayern 's bosses are trying to keep the team 's current struggles in perspective .
" i 'm sure we 'll win lots of titles with louis van gaal , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told supporters at the largely positive annual team meeting last week .
bildunterschrift : hoeness targetted the coach for some ire this fall but the van gaal era is slowly but surely coming to an end .
the dutch coach has indicated he 'd like to lead one of the big national teams to the 2014 world cup , leaving bayern at the latest by the end of next season .
in addition , relations with the number-one man in munich , uli hoeness , are frosty after the bayern president criticized van gaal as overly headstrong and uncommunicative on a television chat show .
" a football club today is n't a one-man show , " club president hoeness fumed .
" he 's difficult to talk to because he does n't accept other people 's opinions . "
ironic words from the head honcho of a club in a curious position .
the team 's future is up in the air despite possessing excellent balance sheets and a host of young of talent .
heading the list of unresolved questions is : who , if anyone , can fill the role of the 58-year-old hoeness ?
and will hoeness let himself be replaced ?
the house that uli built bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's lone champions league title came in 2001 bayern and germany soccer legend franz beckenbauer once famously opined : " bayern is fc hoeness . "
and arguably , the cantankerous striker-turned-commercial manager-turned president is the most successful football executive of all time .
when hoeness became manager in 1979 , at the age of 27 , bayern was germany 's number-two club with an annual turnover of 12 million dm -lrb- 6 million euros -rrb- and 7 million dm in debt .
hoeness commercialized the club and made it germany 's undisputed top dog , holding off challenges from hamburg in the 1980s and dortmund in the 1990s .
meanwhile , as rivals were borrowing money to try to compete , bayern 's accounts were swelling .
bayern 's domestic football dominance has been unchallenged in the new millennium , with the team capturing six of the past ten bundesliga titles .
what 's more , the club 's turnover last year , when hoeness became president , was a record 312 million euros -lrb- $ 418 million -rrb- , and the club 's capital worth is 206 million euros .
bayern ’ s international record may lag behind that of real madrid , barcelona , man united , liverpool and ac milan , but none of those clubs can boast the financial transparency and solidity hoeness has achieved at bayern .
and yet bayern have never achieved the sort of automatic consistency the boss would like to see .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness has never been one to mince words " you know what our dream in the team leadership is , " hoeness said in an interview with munich 's merkur newspaper .
" to just sit in the stands and enjoy without having to say anything .
if a coach comes and everything is super , then we 're happy .
then we sit in the stands and slap our thighs and do n't have to do anything but applaud . "
the problem is , of course , that no coach has lived up to those expectations .
felix magath was fired in 2007 after winning two domestic doubles .
van gaal has come in for a verbal barrage despite the team playing perhaps its most attractive football ever last season . and the perennially tenuous position of bayern coaches has contributed to what 's becoming something of a cycle in munich .
in search of an heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when times get tough , bayern go shopping bayern have maintained their dominance of german football by investing heavily in transfers after non-title years .
luca toni and franck ribery , for instance , were brought in 2007 , and arjen robben and marco gomez before the start of last season .
that strategy has worked because bayern have more than adequate resources and hoeness is among the most astute judges of talents in the game .
but what happens when the boss gets too old to do the job ?
juergen klinsmann was hired as coach in 2008 amidst great ballyhoo about how bayern munich was reforming to meet the demands of the 21st century .
that experiment lasted as long as the buddha statues at bayern 's practice grounds , and it 's the only time there 's been a coach significantly younger than hoeneß in munich .
van gaal has brought some needed tactical acumen to bayern , who now play modern , possession-oriented 4-3-3 football .
what munich now need for the long term is a young coach capable of building on that and of helping manage the empire that hoeness has established .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and klinsmann was not a happy marriage if bayern follow their established pattern , they 'll be investing heavily in some new stars next season , raiding , wherever possible , the teams in the bundesliga they consider their most serious threats .
that 's bad news for dortmund .
and what 's worse is that young coaches with enough status to fit in at bayern are a rarity .
dortmund 's juergen klopp , assuming he can lead his current charges to the title , would be one of the few who fit the bill , and it 's possible to imagine the down-to-earth swabian getting along with the gruff hoeness .
klopp has a contract with dortmund until 2014 , but hoeness is a man who used to getting what he wants .
and what he wants most of all for the long term is a suitable heir .

the united states , britain , germany , france , russia and china -lrb- the so-called 5 + 1 group -rrb- are worried iran could use its uranium enrichment plants to make fuel for warheads rather than reactors .

the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .
as a result , huezler said , manufacturers are free to label their tires as they please .
" some tires from china with m + s marking are not winter tires , " he said but was quick to add that " no serious tire manufacturer " would deliberately mislabel products because of legal ramifications .
a european union labeling ordinance , planned to go into effect in 2012 , will require product specifications and fill the gap in the german legislation , he added .

the combination of hefty snowfall and new rules has led to a shortage of tires approved for ice , snow and slush . since saturday , drivers in germany are required to use winter tires .
but for those still without them , the search could gobble up plenty of time – and the reward could be costly .
" there is definitely a shortage of winter tires , " said peter huelzer , head of the bvr federal association for tire dealers .
" many dealers say they ca n't deliver across all models and one large wholesaler said he may be out of tires by wednesday . "
and even those lucky enough to track down tires could find themselves waiting several days to have them mounted due to huge demand for limited auto hoist capacity in service stations , huelzer added .
more winter tires delivered it 's not as if the industry did n't know the new rules would lead to greater demand .
manufacturers delivered some 25 million winter tires to dealers , or roughly 20 percent more than the previous year , according to huelzer .
theoretically , he said , that increase should have covered demand for the estimated 5 million vehicles still without winter tires .
about 88 percent of vehicles in germany are meanwhile equipped with winter tires .
it looks as if the combination of the new regulations and the unexpected heavy snowfall led to a run on winter tires , " huelzer told deutsche welle .
" i 'm still trying to understand this phenomenon .
if you increase the supply 20 percent , how can you have a shortage ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , approved new winter tire rules one possible answer , he said , is that icy winter conditions across much of europe has created significant demand and may have prompted some international wholesalers to move products to markets where they can achieve higher prices .
also , some dealers may be holding onto their winter tires for a while in the hope of garnering a top price , according to huelzer , who has observed soaring prices for some tires .
" we heard of winter tires for the audi a2 , which typically cost around 45 euros each , selling for as much as 150 euros each , " he said .
" but we 're also hearing that prices are stabilizing .
drivers will just have to shop around if they 're looking for reasonable deals at this point . "
caught in snow or slush compounding the problem is the fact that most manufacturers are now producing summer tires .
" there are n't any new shipments in the pipeline , unless some containers unexpectedly arrive from asia or somewhere else , " huelzer said .
goodyear is the only manufacturer he knows to have cranked open winter tire production again .
bildunterschrift : drivers in germany have been battling snow and ice in recent weeks under the new rules passed by the german government last month , drivers caught with summer tires in ice , snow or slush must pay a 40-euro fine , up from 20 euros in previous years .
and those who obstruct traffic as a result of inappropriate tires face an 80-euro fine and a penalty point on their driver 's record .
germany is among the first in europe to require winter tires , including many of the nordic countries .
by comparison , neighboring austria and switzerland recommend but do n't mandate their use during the winter months .
the new ruling approves all tires that carry an " m + s " -lrb- matsch und schnee -rrb- label , or " slush and snow . "
lawmakers , however , fell short of agreeing on winter tire specifications .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de gaming -pipe- 06.12.2010 europe 's shaky relationship with video games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong growth is expected in the video games market europe has a strong video game industry , one that 's competitive on several levels , but developers in europe are n't being treated as well as their counterparts elsewhere according to a new study . unless europe begins emulating other countries ' policies regarding video game development , the future of the industry might not be so bright , according to a new eu-sponsored report .
last month , the institute for prospective technological studies -lrb- ipts -rrb- , a think-tank for the european commission , published " born digital / grown digital " assessing the european video game industry 's competitiveness .
its findings were generally positive , but it also brought warnings .
the global video game industry is expected to grow 70 percent in the next three years according to industry analysis research by consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers .
according to pwc 's research , italy , spain , uk , germany and france accounted for 10.9 billion euros or 15.2 billion dollars in 2009 , which was 30 percent of the global video games market .
europe boasts several prolific video game developers , including ubisoft s.a. in france , scotland-based rockstar north ltd . , and crytek gmbh in germany - the region has been producing games since the medium existed .
along with video games , europe is also producing aspiring video game developers .
one such place doing this is the cologne game lab at the cologne university of applied sciences .
the institute is currently halfway through its inaugural semester , with five students working their way towards a masters of the arts in game design in two years time .
serious business when they 're done , these men and women will be game designers or concept authors , able to fill a number of roles that require the deft blend of the creative and technical skills of game development .
but in europe , even with the right skills , they might also find themselves struggling to be taken seriously , according to cologne game lab project coordinator , krystian majewski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students at the cologne game lab are pursuing a masters degree in game development " working on games in europe generally still has the stigma of working on toys , of things that are aimed at children , " majewski told deutsche welle .
" and that 's one of the big challenges i think many developers have to struggle with , especially when applying for financing and when they try to present their work as something that 's valuable , " he added .
it 's this perception that seems to lie at the heart of the problem highlighted in the ipts study .
one of the co-authors , jean-paul simon , said the numbers should speak for themselves .
" because of the economic importance , maybe one should take a better look at what this industry is really doing , " he said , and not focus " on the older perception that this is a kind of preserve for young males . "
foreign initiatives other countries have already taken advantage of the growing video game sector according to the report , including canada , the us and south korea .
some of the government incentives for the industry include significant tax credits in quebec , which led to 600-percent growth there since 2003 .
similarly in south korea , tax credits and investment funds for research and development are part of the government 's vision to be in the top three world leaders in game development .
" initially , the -lsb- south korean -rsb- government did n't do anything , but when they found out what we 're finding now , that this is a growth industry , with spill-over effects , they decided to back the industry with all kinds of financial measures , " simon said .
german developer crytek just announced a new online game called warface that it 's targeting to the south korean market , and the experience of doing business in asia has been an eye-opening one .
alternate perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crytek is developing a game for the south korean market " if you say ‘ i 'm a game developer ' in europe they kind of look at you like you 're doing something that 's not a serious job , " said cevat yerli , crytek 's chief executive .
" but in asia , if you 're a game developer it equals almost a rock star .
people have a tremendous amount of respect for being a game developer there . "
in addition to more respect for game development , the asian industry is more advanced in some areas than its european counterparts yerli said , which is a reason why crytek chose to develop an online game there .
" if you want to understand how online works , " yerli added , " asia seems to be ahead of europe and the us by an average of three-to-five years . "
in addition to economic justification , the industry offers spill-over effects for eservices , according to simon . " egovernment has been around for at least 20 years , but most of these services are unpopular which means ease-of-use is not there , " he said .
" so some of these providers could really learn from the way -lsb- games developers -rsb- are doing things in terms of easy interfaces , easy access and easy ways to interrelate with others . "
potential brain drain as jean-paul simon stressed , he and his co-authors tried to emphasize that there is a " window of opportunity " to take advantage of europe 's currently competitive video game development market . and so , faced with such a finite window of opportunity , policy makers must decide if promoting the video game industry is as much of a priority for europe as it is elsewhere .
but with developers in europe competing with government-backed programs in other regions , some of the aspiring game developers from cologne game lab are hearing that there are perhaps more opportunities abroad than at home .
" i recently read that canada , specifically vancouver , is the hot new place for games , " said achim fell , a cologne game lab student .
" i was there this year , and this would be a nice place to live , and also to develop games . "

he said conditions for the safe processing of the fuel were not in place . german environment minister norbert roettgen decided on monday that nuclear waste from a former east german nuclear plant - earmarked for shipment to russia - would stay in germany for the time being .
the federal office for radiation protection had already approved the plan to ship fuel rods from the small baltic port of lubin to russia but , following the analysis of a study commissioned by the government , roettgen 's ministry decided against .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen decided that the russian facility was not up to the task " the result of the study was that a completely safe processing of the fuel rods could not be guaranteed at the mayak site in russia , " a spokeswoman for roettgen said .
" this is why we can not give the green light for the planned transports , which means the fuel rods will have to stay in the ahaus facility until further notice . "
the government was considering sending 951 spent fuel rods from a reactor in rossendorf , near dresden , to mayak in russia .
the rods were used until 1991 and the state of saxony , which owns the rods , put them into interim storage at ahaus , north-rhine westphalia , in 2005 .
the long-term plan was to store them in mayak because they originated in the former soviet union .
mayak is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union and was also home to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
the decision is being hailed by anti-nuclear activists as a victory .
the plan had been to transport 951 old fuel rods from their current location and large german ports such as hamburg had refused to handle the cargo , fearing it may pose hazards .
site of serious accidents russia 's mayak storage and reprocessing unit has been the site of a series of serious accidents since the 1950s and it is now one of the world 's most radioactively contaminated places .
greenpeace germany has been warning against shipping the fuel rodds there all along .
" one does n't have to go back to the accidents that happened there in the 1950s and 60s , " said tobia münchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
" in 2007 , there were two incidents where highly contaminated fuels leaked out of the facility .
and just like the rest of the world , russia does n't have a final storage site for nuclear waste and it has no solution for the problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of nuclear power greeted the news warmly germany 's green party , known for its opposition to nuclear power , said that its own campaign had helped to win the correct decision .
" the minister took the right decision today .
it was the result of a large-scale public debate triggered by public pressure groups and the greens .
and under this pressure , it became impossible for the government to send this spent fuel to russia . " according to the environment ministry , the spent nuclear fuel in question can only safely be stored in the ahaus interim facility for another 35 years .
the hope is that , by then , germany will have found a suitable final storage site .
