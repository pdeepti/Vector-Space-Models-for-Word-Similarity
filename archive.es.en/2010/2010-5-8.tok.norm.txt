but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

flags , music and dancing marchers held large rainbow flags and danced to music as they walked close to the neris river , which runs through the city .
the parade had only been given the go-ahead on friday , after an earlier court-imposed ban .
the ban was criticized by president dalia grybauskaite , some european governments , and the international rights watchdog amnesty .
organizers wanted to draw attention to intolerance of gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transsexuals in strongly roman catholic lithuania .
" we 've made a decisive step towards greater tolerance , " vytautas valentinavicius , one of the organizers , told afp .
german parliament member volker beck joined the marchers and told the german press agency dpa that the march was intended to put pressure on the lithuanian government to improve gay rights .

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .
in 1998 , the four lawyers - known as the " euro rebels " - failed in a legal challenge to prevent germany from entering the single european currency .
despite widespread resistance to the aid plan , german chancellor angela merkel said earlier this week that europe 's future was dependent on its approval. rc / afp / reuters / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .
in 1998 , the four lawyers - known as the " euro rebels " - failed in a legal challenge to prevent germany from entering the single european currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

the historic airstrip , once described by star architect norman foster as " the mother of all airports , " underwent a clean-up to transform the 380-hectare -lrb- 950-acre -rrb- aviation hub into an expansive urban oasis .
although roughly the size of central park in new york , tempelhof park does not boast the hills , dales , ponds or leafy copses of its american counterpart .
instead , it presents open vistas of treeless , but breathtaking expanses , otherwise unheard of in an urban environment .
the old airport terminal is still intact , but the typical aeronautic paraphernalia - the landing lights , signals and other gear - have been removed .
key role in german history as an airport , tempelhof was the leading figure in the first chapter of the cold war , when the soviet union after world war ii attempted to strangle the life blood of west berlin with its now notorious blockade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof will be forever remembered at the focal point of the berlin airlift us and british pilots flew countless missions to airdrop supplies to the trapped residents of the free , but isolated , western half of the city surrounded by the soviet red army .
west berlin 's gateway to the world saved the city from soviet domination .
after reunification in 1989 , the city decided to build a new and modern international terminal at schoenefeld on the southeastern outskirts of former east berlin .
but the bulldozers are n't finished with tempelhof just yet .
starting in 2013 , the new park will undergo a four-year , 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- facelift to become the home of the 2017 international garden exhibition .
by then , it should look a lot more like its storied new york counterpart. gb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy .
-lrb- 03.03.2009 -rrb- german carmakers look to china for relief for a long time , auto shows in china were ridiculed by the general public .
chinese carmakers regularly presented cars which just looked too much like western models to be their own developments .
now , however , chinese carmakers are being seen as potential rescuers of western companies in times of crisis .
german ceos at this year 's auto show in shanghai seem to be especially optimistic .

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .

officers broke up a crowd of about 2,000 protesters as demonstrators threw water bottles , fire-crackers and stones from behind security barriers .
some 400 people took part in the two-hour baltic pride 2010 march , demanding equality in a sealed-off area of the capital vilnius .

flags , music and dancing marchers held large rainbow flags and danced to music as they walked close to the neris river , which runs through the city .
the parade had only been given the go-ahead on friday , after an earlier court-imposed ban .
the ban was criticized by president dalia grybauskaite , some european governments , and the international rights watchdog amnesty .
organizers wanted to draw attention to intolerance of gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transsexuals in strongly roman catholic lithuania .
" we 've made a decisive step towards greater tolerance , " vytautas valentinavicius , one of the organizers , told afp .
german parliament member volker beck joined the marchers and told the german press agency dpa that the march was intended to put pressure on the lithuanian government to improve gay rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .

however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .

gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy .
-lrb- 03.03.2009 -rrb- german carmakers look to china for relief for a long time , auto shows in china were ridiculed by the general public .
chinese carmakers regularly presented cars which just looked too much like western models to be their own developments .
now , however , chinese carmakers are being seen as potential rescuers of western companies in times of crisis .
german ceos at this year 's auto show in shanghai seem to be especially optimistic .

and he has n't been forgotten .
in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he has n't been forgotten .
in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 08.05.2010 german car industry is rolling again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is putting more money into its operations in china german auto part suppliers have recovered from the global economic crisis better than expected , according to germany 's automotive industry association .
the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy .
-lrb- 03.03.2009 -rrb- german carmakers look to china for relief for a long time , auto shows in china were ridiculed by the general public .
chinese carmakers regularly presented cars which just looked too much like western models to be their own developments .
now , however , chinese carmakers are being seen as potential rescuers of western companies in times of crisis .
german ceos at this year 's auto show in shanghai seem to be especially optimistic .
-lrb- 22.04.2009 -rrb- feedback is the crisis in the auto industry really over ?

some 400 people took part in the two-hour baltic pride 2010 march , demanding equality in a sealed-off area of the capital vilnius .
vilnius county police chief kestutis lancinskas said the arrests had been made for public order offences , including carrying offensive weapons .

the parade had only been given the go-ahead on friday , after an earlier court-imposed ban .
the ban was criticized by president dalia grybauskaite , some european governments , and the international rights watchdog amnesty .
organizers wanted to draw attention to intolerance of gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transsexuals in strongly roman catholic lithuania .
" we 've made a decisive step towards greater tolerance , " vytautas valentinavicius , one of the organizers , told afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2010 pope accepts resignation of german bishop in abuse probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augsburg bishop bows to abuse allegations pope benedict xvi on saturday accepted the resignation of german bishop walter mixa who has been accused of hitting children .
it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .
in 1998 , the four lawyers - known as the " euro rebels " - failed in a legal challenge to prevent germany from entering the single european currency .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .

they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .

some 400 people took part in the two-hour baltic pride 2010 march , demanding equality in a sealed-off area of the capital vilnius .
vilnius county police chief kestutis lancinskas said the arrests had been made for public order offences , including carrying offensive weapons .

the mps were being charged with attempting to incite a riot , lancinskas told reporters .
flags , music and dancing marchers held large rainbow flags and danced to music as they walked close to the neris river , which runs through the city .
the parade had only been given the go-ahead on friday , after an earlier court-imposed ban .
the ban was criticized by president dalia grybauskaite , some european governments , and the international rights watchdog amnesty .
organizers wanted to draw attention to intolerance of gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transsexuals in strongly roman catholic lithuania .
" we 've made a decisive step towards greater tolerance , " vytautas valentinavicius , one of the organizers , told afp .
german parliament member volker beck joined the marchers and told the german press agency dpa that the march was intended to put pressure on the lithuanian government to improve gay rights .
" this is a signal to the lithuanian government that we are in europe and lesbian and gay people have equal rights , " he said. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .
in 1998 , the four lawyers - known as the " euro rebels " - failed in a legal challenge to prevent germany from entering the single european currency .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy .
-lrb- 03.03.2009 -rrb- german carmakers look to china for relief for a long time , auto shows in china were ridiculed by the general public .
chinese carmakers regularly presented cars which just looked too much like western models to be their own developments .
now , however , chinese carmakers are being seen as potential rescuers of western companies in times of crisis .
german ceos at this year 's auto show in shanghai seem to be especially optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the historic airstrip , once described by star architect norman foster as " the mother of all airports , " underwent a clean-up to transform the 380-hectare -lrb- 950-acre -rrb- aviation hub into an expansive urban oasis .
although roughly the size of central park in new york , tempelhof park does not boast the hills , dales , ponds or leafy copses of its american counterpart .
instead , it presents open vistas of treeless , but breathtaking expanses , otherwise unheard of in an urban environment .
the old airport terminal is still intact , but the typical aeronautic paraphernalia - the landing lights , signals and other gear - have been removed .
key role in german history as an airport , tempelhof was the leading figure in the first chapter of the cold war , when the soviet union after world war ii attempted to strangle the life blood of west berlin with its now notorious blockade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof will be forever remembered at the focal point of the berlin airlift us and british pilots flew countless missions to airdrop supplies to the trapped residents of the free , but isolated , western half of the city surrounded by the soviet red army .
west berlin 's gateway to the world saved the city from soviet domination .
after reunification in 1989 , the city decided to build a new and modern international terminal at schoenefeld on the southeastern outskirts of former east berlin .
but the bulldozers are n't finished with tempelhof just yet .
starting in 2013 , the new park will undergo a four-year , 60-million-euro -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- facelift to become the home of the 2017 international garden exhibition .
by then , it should look a lot more like its storied new york counterpart. gb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 08.05.2010 postcard from europe : tito nostalgia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tito ruled the yugoslav federation for 35 years until his death in 1980 tuesday marked the 30th anniversary of the death of former yugoslav leader josip broz tito .
and he has n't been forgotten .
in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de cult of tito still going strong thirty years after his death , josip broz tito is more popular than ever .

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

and he has n't been forgotten .
in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 08.05.2010 german car industry is rolling again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is putting more money into its operations in china german auto part suppliers have recovered from the global economic crisis better than expected , according to germany 's automotive industry association .
the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .
in 1998 , the four lawyers - known as the " euro rebels " - failed in a legal challenge to prevent germany from entering the single european currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .

germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and he has n't been forgotten .
in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in this postcard from belgrade , mark lowen looks at the phenomenon of yugo-nostalgia . many people told me many conflicting things after i arrived in belgrade last year – everyone in the balkans has their version of history – but one view was often shared : a fondness for the past , the greatness of yugoslavia , when this southern european country mattered immensely on the world stage and when yugoslavs of all ethnic and religious origins lived harmoniously in their beautiful land . behind it all was the hand of josip broz ' tito ' – that half-croat , half-slovene marshal who rose to power heading the communist resistance against the nazis during the second world war and then led the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia until his death thirty years ago . his was a unique sort of communism – far more open to the west and liberal than his stalinist counterparts , yugoslavs could travel without visas to almost everywhere in the world . the country was a founding member of the non-aligned movement – that militarily neutral grouping that ensured yugoslavia sided neither with the us nor the soviet union , but gained an influential , impartial voice .
and nationalism of the different yugoslav republics was kept under wraps to ensure unity . yugoslavia 's golden era ? people here recall that time – particularly the 1970s – as the golden era .
many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .

many never even bothered to leave the country – spending their holidays on the coast of croatia , the mountains of montenegro or the bustling hearts of belgrade , sarajevo or zagreb . but ten years after tito 's death , it all began to unravel , as nationalist leaders fuelled ethnic conflict , leading to the devastating wars in slovenia , croatia , bosnia and then kosovo .
the country fragmented into its constituent republics .
tito 's dream had died . thirty years on , yugo-nostalgia still exists .
visitors from across the former yugoslavia descended on his tomb in belgrade last week in their droves , one woman crying when she recalled the greatness of life under tito . from the ashes of yugoslavia emerged poor , isolated countries like serbia , only now recovering from the sanctions and bombing of the 1990s .
the region has been left out of the eu – just slovenia has joined , while the others are waiting anxiously in the queue for membership .
and distrust lingers between the different ethnic groups – especially in bosnia where ethnic serbs , croats and muslims are perhaps more segregated now than ever . in fact , the ruthless sides of life under tito have been relegated within popular memory : his work camps for political dissidents , his secret police , his suppression of religion – he , like other communist leaders ruled with an iron fist .
instead , there is a longing for the peace , stability and influence of the past , of tito 's land . his legacy is much debated – some say he sewed the seeds of the wars that ensued – but his profile and his leadership is widely missed . author : mark lowen editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

officers broke up a crowd of about 2,000 protesters as demonstrators threw water bottles , fire-crackers and stones from behind security barriers .
some 400 people took part in the two-hour baltic pride 2010 march , demanding equality in a sealed-off area of the capital vilnius .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .
according to experts , the auto industy will be hit by a slump in sales in western europe .
-lrb- 02.01.2010 -rrb- car sales in germany rise in february , but future still cloudy government bonuses for people to scrap old cars and buy new ones led to a 21.5 percent boost compared to the previous year .
but this bright figure ca n't conceal that the general outlook for the industry is gloomy .
-lrb- 03.03.2009 -rrb- german carmakers look to china for relief for a long time , auto shows in china were ridiculed by the general public .
chinese carmakers regularly presented cars which just looked too much like western models to be their own developments .
now , however , chinese carmakers are being seen as potential rescuers of western companies in times of crisis .
german ceos at this year 's auto show in shanghai seem to be especially optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 no big changes for uk 's europe policy after election , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels does n't need to worry about a new british stance towards the eu it 's still unclear what a new british government could look like after inconclusive elections .
but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

but one thing will remain unchanged - the uk 's stance towards the eu , an expert tells deutsche welle . klaus larres , professor of history and international relations at the university of ulster , is currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in washington .
he has published extensively on britain and british foreign policy .
deutsche welle : the predictions about the british election have come true . for the first time in decades there is a hung parliament . what is your assessment of the situation and the most likely scenario ?
klaus larres : it looks as though prime minister gordon brown has the right to form a government as the incumbent prime minister , so he will talk to the liberal democrats .
and at the same time the conservative leader david cameron will also talk to the liberal democrats .
so the liberal democrats have really turned it into a situation which in germany the small fdp had for a decade : they are the kingmakers .
they can decide who to form a government with .
the conservatives will be the strongest party in parliament and therefore make a claim to form the new government .
what does that mean for europe and british foreign policy ?
after all tory leader david cameron is considered a euro-skeptic and has taken his party out of the alliance of the european people 's party .
yes , but it is by no means clear whether he will be able to form a new government .
but if he were fortunate enough to get enough seats and votes together than he could embark on forming a government and his government would certainly be more euro-skeptic than a labour and liberal democrat government .
but i think one should n't exaggerate the claims and statements made during an election campaign .
so while david cameron is not a pro-europe fanatic , whether he will be another mrs. thatcher who was very skeptical about a more integrated europe - that is another question .
during the election campaign he had to pander to his own party 's anti-european right wing , so he had to come out with perhaps more severe anti-european statements than the way he would govern if he was able to form a government .
so i am not that pessimistic that we would really see much of a difference in this regard in david cameron 's european policy .
there might be nuances that might be different , but i do n't think he would adopt a totally hostile attitude .
but what is certainly sure is that britain would not join the euro in the foreseeable future .
i think that is certain under a government led by david cameron , but it would probably also be the case if labour is returned to power .
prime minister gordon brown and his labour party have lost their majority in parliament , but according to british election rules has the right to try to build a government .
will he be able to that after this defeat at the polls ?
he may just be able to do so .
but he is in a predicament because he and the labour party lost votes and seats and the liberal democrats lost votes and seats .
so if the two parties were able to form a new coalition government they are morally in a weak position because it would be a government of the two defeated parties .
and that is never going to convince the voters and above all they wo n't be able to convince the markets .
the british pound has already gone down on the international currency markets , the uk is on track to have the largest deficit of any country in europe and a weak government formed by parties which have actually lost the election - that will not go down too well and will not stabilize the british economy and the british currency .
so whether that is really the best solution for the country i very much doubt .
as you just mentioned , the liberal democrats fared worse than they expected , winning less seats than five years ago .
how would you rate their chances to push for a reform of britain 's electoral system now ?
the party 's long-time goal of introducing proportional representation into the british system and getting rid of the so-called first-past-the-post system must be seen skeptically with regard to forming a coalition with the conservatives .
the conservatives would undermine their own position in british politics if they went along with proportional representation .
if the liberal democrats were to form a government with labour than i think labour would probably agree to going ahead with some reform of proportional representation .
essentially , labour would have to offer something to the liberal democrats to be able to form a coalition government with them and what they would have to offer would be the introduction of some form of proportional representation in britain .
nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader , said the tories as the winner of the election have the right to try to build a government .
how likely is a coalition between the liberal democrats who are viewed as pro-europe and want election reform and the conservatives who are considered anti-europe and staunchly oppose election reform ?
i think the hurdle is electoral reform , it is not europe .
i do n't think the conservatives are so anti-europe , at least not the leadership of the conservative party , that it would be impossible for the liberal democrats to enter into a coalition over the question of europe .
the hurdle really is electoral reform .
i do n't think that the conservatives will be able to agree to that at all , because they would undermine their own position in british politics in the future .
the conservatives have done relatively well by becoming the strongest party in parliament under a system of proportional representation .
there is no rush for them to go down that road now as they would weaken their own future .
and the liberal democrats of course would strengthen their own future with the introduction of proportional representation .
these positions are really at loggerheads and i ca n't see how both parties could agree on some sort of compromise .
so the conservatives will have to look for other coalition partners than the liberal democrats .
they will of course talk to the liberal democrats , but i would be very surprised if a deal could be achieved .
but the tories have other possibilities .
they can talk to the dup in northern ireland , which have around eight seats , they can also talk to some of the smaller nationalist parties who may not want to enter a formal coalition with the conservatives , but may want to extend their informal support for a minority government led by the conservatives and with the help of the northern irish dup .
so david cameron is not entirely dependent on the liberal democrats .
that would be the easier , the clearer option obviously , but i do n't think that will come about .
the greens won their first ever seat in british parliament .
is it a sign that britain is becoming more ecologically-oriented like other european countries ? i would not give too much importance to that .
brighton is a fairly progressive place where a lot of young people live .
so that they would return a green candidate is not that surprising .
i think it is more surprising that nowhere else in the country there was a similar vote .
so i think that was in a way lucky for the green candidate , but i do n't think that can be repeated in any other parts of the uk at the moment .
while the uk has moved towards a more ecological position on the whole , i do n't think this is already a general trend which will translate into votes and seats unfortunately .

the entire sector appears to be coming out of its slump . auto parts suppliers , particularly in germany , are benefiting from a surge in global car production that began at the start of this year .
domestic and foreign orders with german suppliers rose 40 percent and sales 25 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period a year earlier , according to the vda automotive industry association .
the association expects global car sales to grow by 4 percent to 57 million cars this year compared to 2009 .
market research and consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers estimates global car production this year will reach 64 million vehicles , down 4 million from the pre-crisis peak of 69 million vehicles in 2007 but showing a strong rebound over the past two years .
growth in china china will play a key role .
in 2009 , the chinese car market experienced explosive growth , up 47 percent over the previous year to 8.4 million vehicles , according to vda .
in the first quarter of 2010 , more than 2.8 million cars were sold .
for the year the association forecasts a 16 percent increase in sales to 9.7 million vehicles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german brands continue to lead when it comes to premium cars sales vda president matthias wissmann said german cars and component manufacturers have moved rapidly to establish local production in china .
within just two years , he said , german carmakers nearly doubled production in chinese plants to 1.25 million vehicles , while increasing exports by 57 percent in the same period .
alone in the first quarter of 2010 , german car sales in china soared 80 percent , accounting for every fifth new car registration in the country .
signs are pointing to a recovery in the global car industry .
the world 's biggest car markets have shown double-digit increases in production in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a year earlier .
the severe downturn in car manufacturing caused by the banking and economic crisis may , indeed , be over , analysts say .
investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german car industry changes gears to suit global market german car makers are bracing for a tougher year ahead after government subsidies helped them get through 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .

germany 's highest court ruled against the appeal on saturday . germany 's highest court on saturday rejected a request by a group of academics to block the immediate release of berlin 's multi-billion-euro loan to debt-stricken greece .
a group of four lawyers and one businessman had argued that the financial rescue package broke german constitutional law , that it was not provided for under european union treaties and that it would lead to policies that cause inflation .
they lodged their appeal in the hope that the court would halt the flow of funds while the case was being considered .
the court rejected their request , arguing that there was insufficient evidence that the property rights under the german constitution would be severely and irreversibly altered .
" the complainants did not present concrete evidence that their rights , in particular as regards article 14 -lrb- on property rights -rrb- of the basic law -lrb- constitution -rrb- , would be severely and irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan , " the court said in a statement .
court to give ruling later a court spokeswoman said it was still to decide on a parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but that this was unlikely to take place before the funds were released to greece .
germany 's parliament approved the transfer of more than 22.4 billion euros -lrb- 28 billion dollars -rrb- over three years on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.05.2010 crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nrw voters will pass judgement on the merkel government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government . elections in north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- have always been considered an important cog in federal politics in germany .
the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

investments in global expansion “ the auto parts sector has gone through some pain over the past two years but the worst seems to be over , ” jack sayer , an analyst with the gerson lehrman group , wrote in a report .
volkswagen , ford and fiat are among the many carmakers that have announced significant investment plans for their global manufacturing operations , especially in china and latin america .
despite the rebound , challenges continue to confront the industry .
the costs for steel , copper , platinum , plastics and other manufacturing materials are rising .
the lingering effects of the global economic crisis , the possibility of more job cuts and the high level of consumer debt in key markets such as the united states may dampen the appetite of many consumers for a new car . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state , with around 18 million inhabitants , is the country 's most populous and swings among its 13.5 million voters have often preceded similar shifts at the national level .
influential news weekly die zeit 's website has called the nrw race " the mini national election . "
political scientist gerd langguth from the university of bonn in nrw said this is the reason why the whole country will be keenly watching the upcoming vote .
" the elections in north rhine-westphalia are the most important , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ firstly , it 's the first election since the national election last year , so it 's more or less also a political test on federal policies .
and also it 's the only election this year . "
too close to call fighting it out is incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and hannelore kraft of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft has helped the spd regain lost ground in nrw for the last five years , ruettgers has led a coalition government involving his cdu and junior partners the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - a union that is mirrored at the federal level under chancellor angela merkel - but the partnership has seen a steady decline in support during its time in office , leaving the result of the upcoming election on a knife 's edge .
however there is much more at stake over these next few days than who rules nrw .
if voters turn against cdu-fdp on sunday then not only will the composition of the state parliament in duesseldorf be altered , but also that of germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , where the federal cdu-fdp coalition currently enjoys a majority .
in germany , the individual state governments vote directly on the decisions taken by the federal government , and this is done through the bundesrat , where north rhine-westphalia enjoys the highest-possible number of votes .
holding a majority in the bundesrat is essential to the federal government being able to pass legislation with little opposition .
nrw ' political test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruettgers ' government has steadily lost support if the opposition social democrats win in nrw , causing the merkel government to lose its majority in the bundesrat , then the cdu will begin to encounter much more resistance when trying to pass legislation .
germany 's international partners have already accused merkel of foot-dragging on the greek debt crisis because of the nrw election and ultimately driving up the cost of the european union aid deal for athens .
merkel was afraid of angering cdu voters over germany 's contribution to the deal , which has remained deeply unpopular among voters , prompting nrw premier ruettgers to comment this week that " greece is the number-one issue in the campaign . "
speed-bumps on the horizon among the federal government policies at stake , should the spd win in north rhine-westphalia , are those on nuclear power and on tax cuts .
the former federal cdu-spd grand coalition government was planning to pull the plug on the country 's nuclear plants .
but when the cdu opted to form government with the fdp after federal elections last september this went out the window .
if the social democrats win the nrw election then merkel 's government could have considerable difficulties passing legislation allowing for an extension of the lifespan of the country 's nuclear plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the merkel government 's effectiveness is on the line and tax cuts , a key element to merkel 's election campaign last year , could also face considerable hurdles should the cdu lose its upper house majority .
other key issues affecting germany at the moment which have driven a wedge between cdu and spd , such as the war in afghanistan and the ongoing greek debt crisis , could also be thrown up in the air should cdu-fdp lose north rhine-westphalia .
gerd langguth told deutsche welle that a loss for the cdu in the state election could also cause a reappraisal within the party of its own profile .
" and the debate will be , what is the political profile of the cdu at this moment in a lot of questions concerning afghanistan , the environment , the social market system , " he said .
" and i will predict that if mr ruettgers loses the election then there will be a huge debate in her party , merkel 's party . "
although merkel 's room for maneuver is on the line , nils diederich of berlin 's free university said her job is safe .
" merkel is still too strong to throw in the towel , " he said .

it 's the latest in a string of catholic officials forced to quit over an abuse scandal . a statement from the vatican said the pope had accepted the resignation tendered by controversial augsburg bishop , walter mixa , who has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal .
the 68-year-old bishop found himself caught up in the catholic church 's child sex abuse scandal in april after first denying , and then admitting , that he had slapped children decades ago at a children 's home when he was still a parish priest .
eight people who lived at the home have come forward with claims that he beat them with his fists , a stick and even a carpet beater .
after weeks of denials , mixa recently admitted he could “ not rule out a cuff or two around the ear 20 years ago ” and added that “ i very much regret that today . ”
new allegations against mixa further controversy erupted on friday when prosecutors said they were investigating allegations of sex abuse by bishop mixa , following claims of abuse by a former alleged victim .
a spokeswoman for the justice ministry in the southern german state of bavaria confirmed that prosecutors in the city of ingolstadt were conducting a preliminary inquiry into the sex claims .
mixa 's lawyer , gerhard decker , told the regional augsburger allgemeine newspaper that his client " utterly denies the allegations being made against him and will cooperate with prosecutors to the utmost to bring this case to a clear close . "
german weekly magazine , focus , reported on saturday that the pope had been told by senior german clergy of the sex abuse allegations against mixa before the bishop had tendered his resignation .
" the events in recent weeks have hugely damaged the whole diocese of augsburg and the catholic church in germany , " head of the german bishops ’ conference , robert zollitsch said on saturday .
" the swift decision of the pope has created the needed clarity .
it gives all those involved a chance for a new beginning . "
a recent spate of sex abuse allegations against members of the clergy has tarnished the image of the roman catholic church .
in recent weeks , a belgian bishop resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy and three irish bishops quit over their handling of sexual abuse cases. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
