its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.09.2010 germany grapples with future of aging architectural treasures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the berlin city palace has been put on hold for budget reasons tourists flock to germany , in part for its old architecture .
but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .
you need a lot of brain power and creativity to integrate modern features , such as insulation , into a historic reconstruction . " the city palace has yet to be rebuilt , but with its many historical buildings , germany will have plenty of other opportunities to choose between new and redone . the exhibition " the history of reconstruction ; the construction of history " at the pinakothek in munich currently examines societies ' decisions to rebuild valuable buildings which had been damaged by time or war .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 07.09.2010 karstadt deal may be too late to save iconic chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt stores need millions of euros in renovations germany 's iconic karstadt department store chain is saved for now , but there is reasonable cause to doubt the company 's future in its current form .
its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.09.2010 eu members agree to submit future budgets to brussels for scrutiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to keep the euro 's value out of the sewers as member states continue spending beyond their means , the eu has agreed to set up a watchdog to monitor national budgets .
the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.09.2010 eu members agree to submit future budgets to brussels for scrutiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to keep the euro 's value out of the sewers as member states continue spending beyond their means , the eu has agreed to set up a watchdog to monitor national budgets .
the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 07.09.2010 german police raid country 's largest neo-nazi organization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were looking for any incriminating evidence german police raided the country 's largest neo-nazi group , which is suspected of disseminating propaganda to neo-nazis in prison , where they are prone to abandoning their beliefs and the movement . police across germany raided the offices and apartments of known members of the hilfsorganisation fuer nationale und politische gefangene und deren angehoerige -lrb- hng -rrb- , the country 's largest and most influential neo-nazi organization , on tuesday morning .
the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .

law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .

ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 07.09.2010 german police raid country 's largest neo-nazi organization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were looking for any incriminating evidence german police raided the country 's largest neo-nazi group , which is suspected of disseminating propaganda to neo-nazis in prison , where they are prone to abandoning their beliefs and the movement . police across germany raided the offices and apartments of known members of the hilfsorganisation fuer nationale und politische gefangene und deren angehoerige -lrb- hng -rrb- , the country 's largest and most influential neo-nazi organization , on tuesday morning .
the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .
raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to raise the retirement age to 62 more than 200 rallies and marches are scheduled throughout france on tuesday , with trade unions hoping that at least two million people will demonstrate .
recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 07.09.2010 german police raid country 's largest neo-nazi organization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were looking for any incriminating evidence german police raided the country 's largest neo-nazi group , which is suspected of disseminating propaganda to neo-nazis in prison , where they are prone to abandoning their beliefs and the movement . police across germany raided the offices and apartments of known members of the hilfsorganisation fuer nationale und politische gefangene und deren angehoerige -lrb- hng -rrb- , the country 's largest and most influential neo-nazi organization , on tuesday morning .
the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.09.2010 germany grapples with future of aging architectural treasures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the berlin city palace has been put on hold for budget reasons tourists flock to germany , in part for its old architecture .
but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ?

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .

in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one .

" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 07.09.2010 german police raid country 's largest neo-nazi organization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were looking for any incriminating evidence german police raided the country 's largest neo-nazi group , which is suspected of disseminating propaganda to neo-nazis in prison , where they are prone to abandoning their beliefs and the movement . police across germany raided the offices and apartments of known members of the hilfsorganisation fuer nationale und politische gefangene und deren angehoerige -lrb- hng -rrb- , the country 's largest and most influential neo-nazi organization , on tuesday morning .
the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .

despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .

a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .

the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .
raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to raise the retirement age to 62 more than 200 rallies and marches are scheduled throughout france on tuesday , with trade unions hoping that at least two million people will demonstrate .
recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 07.09.2010 ars electronica festival aims to fix a broken world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ars electronica festival 2010 is being held this year at the tabakfabrik in linz , austria .
linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 07.09.2010 ars electronica festival aims to fix a broken world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ars electronica festival 2010 is being held this year at the tabakfabrik in linz , austria .
linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

in a statement released ahead of tuesday 's meeting , the federal association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- warned that an endorsement of the global regulations on the table could force german banks to reduce their lending activity in order to increase their capital base .
the body said it would be " counter-productive " to insist on a strict ratio linking germany 's savings and cooperative banks ' capital levels to their lending abilities , because they rely on deposits but have no real equity .
the basel committee defines core capital as only equity and retained earnings , but does not take into account the other capital contributions these banks use to finance many of the nation 's small and medium-sized businesses .
" going too far would threaten the economic recovery and positive developments on the labor market , " the statement said .
the bdb further warned that the basel iii overhaul of the sector could see the country 's top 10 banks having to raise as much as 104 billion euros -lrb- $ 135 billion -rrb- of fresh capital .

tuesday 's meeting is due to fix those ratios .
the expectation is that the minimum tier one capital ratio will be upped from 4 percent to 6-8 percent , while the core tier one ratio will increase from 4 percent to 4 percent .
basel ii , the predecessor to the current committee , was never implemented in either the us or europe , and the bdb says there is a risk that basel iii will go the same way , allowing us banks to gain a competitive edge .
the planned reforms will be released for final approval ahead of a g20 meeting in seoul in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.09.2010 eu 's barroso says economic recovery gathering steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu recovery is more robust than expected , says barroso the prospects for economic recovery are looking up , predicts european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .

phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .

filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .
this column reflects the opinions of the authors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .
you need a lot of brain power and creativity to integrate modern features , such as insulation , into a historic reconstruction . " the city palace has yet to be rebuilt , but with its many historical buildings , germany will have plenty of other opportunities to choose between new and redone . the exhibition " the history of reconstruction ; the construction of history " at the pinakothek in munich currently examines societies ' decisions to rebuild valuable buildings which had been damaged by time or war .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .
raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to raise the retirement age to 62 more than 200 rallies and marches are scheduled throughout france on tuesday , with trade unions hoping that at least two million people will demonstrate .
recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .
raising the retirement age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants to raise the retirement age to 62 more than 200 rallies and marches are scheduled throughout france on tuesday , with trade unions hoping that at least two million people will demonstrate .
recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 07.09.2010 french workers strike en masse against sarkozy 's pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have skipped work to protest a french trade union estimated that 2.5 million workers hit the streets tuesday , protesting plans to raise france 's retirement age to 62 from 60 .
the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .

a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

international experts are worried about the health of the country 's young population . seeing smoking teenagers is not uncommon in indonesia . during the last few years , cigarette smokers are becoming younger and younger in this country .
however , seeing a boy like the two-year-old ardi rizal who started smoking when he was just 18 months old was still a shock for many people . according to the central statistics agency , the percentage of children aged between 5 to 9 years who smoke increased from less than 1 percent in 2001 to nearly 3 percent in 2004 . tobacco industry seduces youth based on the national global youth tobacco survey in 2006 , nearly 40 percent of indonesian youth have tried out cigarettes , and more than 30 percent have had their first cigarette before the age of 10 .
as a result , around 12 percent of indonesian youth are regular smokers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenager smoking on the streets of jakarta " we believe the reason that a large number of children and adolescents take up smoking here in indonesia is because firstly , they can buy a single cigarette ; not just in one single package " , explains louise baker from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- in indonesia .
she also complains that tobacco advertising is not as regulated as it should be .
baker would like to see a ban of all public advertising , promotion , and sponsorship by cigarette companies , because advertising encourages and attracts young people to take up smoking . economic and social problems due to child smoking tobacco is the cause of many diseases which can be fatal , including cancer .
according to the world health organization , tobacco-related diseases caused about 400,000 deaths in indonesia in 2005 . besides health concerns , smoking also causes other problems to indonesian children and adolescents .
louise baker shows that there are significant economic and social problems connected to the smoking as well .
" around 20 percent of the income of a poor indonesian family is spent on cigarettes .
so they spend slightly more on rice than they do on cigarettes " , she says , " they spend less on food , on health care and on education .
and i think that is a potential impact for a future generation of indonesian children , if they are not spending that money on education and health care . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco ad in jakarta government must protect youngsters indonesia is the country with the third highest consumption of tobacco in the world .
about 70 percent of men in the country are smokers . mark hurley from the campaign for tobacco-free kids in the us believes the indonesian government must act immediately on this problem : " the government must act now to protect young people from tobacco use , and the government can do this by enforcing an advertising ban , raising taxes on tobacco products , and increasing public awareness of the harm of tobacco use . " the world health organization has passed a framework convention on tobacco control - trying to ban smoking in public places .
indonesia is the only country in southeast asia that has not yet signed on to this treaty . experts maintain that even though smoking is potentially addictive , smokers can still get rid of their smoking habit , if they are provided enough support .
after all , even world-famous two-year-old ardi rizal has reportedly quit smoking . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the short film " kalkutta " is part fiction , part documentary . many couples , who can not have children , adopt .
according to unicef statistics , 9 percent of the world ’ s orphans live in india .
it has become common for foreign couples to travel to india to adopt , however they often run into difficulties .
the legal formalities are often exhausting .
and some orphanages try to dupe foreign couple with promises of children and then disappear with the money handed over . the german-made docu-fiction film " kalkutta " examines some of the problems couples face .
julia richter , a popular actress on german televisions , plays a mother who is looking for a child in india to adopt . finding parents for children instead of children for parents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wotan moehrung , julia richter and an indian actress in the movie " i am a real mother and so i try to compare the situation , it ’ s like a real birth .
i come to india to get a child " , richter describes her role .
" my husband finds out that this child has parents , who are alive and are looking for him .
he wants to bring back the little boy and i am against it , because i feel like a mother and i want to keep him . " stephan gieren , who produced the movie , says that the film is about the various aspects of adoption .
" adoption is not only a way to help .
adoption always involves problems for the child when it grows up , for making it integrate into the new society " , he explains .
" adoption should be finding parents for children and not about finding children for parents . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cast of " kalkutta " indian children becoming german although there have been cases in the past where people who have adopted children have turned out to be unfit , gieren thinks that this is not usually the case in germany .
he personally believes 99 percent of people who travel to india to adopt an orphan really care for the children .
" in germany we have a very strict system of checking the social , financial and psychological background of those people who are willing to adopt " , he explains . gieren thinks that it is easy for adopted children to adapt once they arrive in germany .
due to german law the child will become a german citizen .

that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 07.09.2010 germany grapples with future of aging architectural treasures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the berlin city palace has been put on hold for budget reasons tourists flock to germany , in part for its old architecture .
but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .

filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

however , the expanded government , which now has 48 cabinet members instead of 36 , will retain finance minister george papaconstantinou and stay the course on a package of austerity measures designed to pull greece out of its fiscal doldrums .
the european union and international monetary fund cobbled together a 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 140-billion -rrb- rescue package for greece after athens was pushed to the brink of default earlier this year .
in exchange for the bailout , the greek government agreed to sweeping economic reforms , draconian spending cuts and tax increases , which sparked protests across the country .
the cabinet reshuffle is meant to boost key economic and social policy areas which are seen as lagging behind , and to appease a public angry about the tough austerity measures .
papandreou has been criticized for taking too long to announce his spending cuts , and is now anxious to placate voters with municipal elections coming up in early november and the belt-tightening policies beginning to take hold .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .

the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .

hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .

the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .

hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .

another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .

the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .

increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .

the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

adoption always involves problems for the child when it grows up , for making it integrate into the new society " , he explains .
" adoption should be finding parents for children and not about finding children for parents . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cast of " kalkutta " indian children becoming german although there have been cases in the past where people who have adopted children have turned out to be unfit , gieren thinks that this is not usually the case in germany .
he personally believes 99 percent of people who travel to india to adopt an orphan really care for the children .
" in germany we have a very strict system of checking the social , financial and psychological background of those people who are willing to adopt " , he explains . gieren thinks that it is easy for adopted children to adapt once they arrive in germany .
due to german law the child will become a german citizen .
the child will change the surname , get a german passport .
" even in germany he will no longer be considered an indian any more " , gieren smiles , " even though the color of the skin will always be different . " the film kalkutta is mostly in german although there are some english dialogues when the german actors are talking with indian actors .
the filmmakers are planning to screen the movie in germany first and then bring it to the kolkata film festival . author : debarati mukherjee -lrb- kolkata -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "

however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "

sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .

also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

company reps also demonstrate a new voice translation service that will run on google translate on google 's android phones . in a keynote speech at the ifa consumer electronics trade show in berlin today , google ceo eric schmidt announced that his company would be bringing the web to television screens across the united states later this year .
schmidt said that this service would bring full internet browsing to televisions , and would link television programming metadata , and the larger internet with what viewers are watching at any given moment .
" we will work with content providers but it is very unlikely that we will get into actual content production , " schmidt told journalists after a keynote speech to the ifa .
he added that this service would extend to europe and the rest of the world sometime in 2011 .
previously , the company had announced on its blog in may that it would be bringing google tv to market , but had not announced a firm release timeframe .
in the united states , google tv will be available via three new products , including a sony hdtv , a sony blu-ray player and a logitech set-top box .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google ceo eric schmidt added that he met with members of the german government to discuss google street view following his talk , audience members asked the ceo about google street view , which has come under fire from the german government .
schmidt said he had anticipated that there would be problems in germany .
he also mentioned that he had talks with some members of the german government during his stay in berlin .
" what 's unusual is that we 've given you -lrb- the germans -rrb- the possibility to opt out before -lrb- the launch -rrb- , " he said . " we have never done that anywhere else . "
google voice translation also on its way google representatives also demonstrated a new voice translation technology that can slowly interpret different spoken foreign languages .
during schmidt 's keynote , miguel barra , a product management director at google , showed that like its online text counterpart , the translation algorithm is not perfect .
initially , it translated the phrase from a native german speaker – " welche farbe ? " – as " which cable ? " instead of " what color ? "
but on the third try , the software worked correctly .
the voice translation capability can be installed on an internet-connected android phone and allows people to utter simple messages into a phone and hear a translation , although it does not yet work for live telephone conversations between two different phones .
barra added that conversation mode in google translate would be released in the next few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.09.2010 eu 's barroso says economic recovery gathering steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu recovery is more robust than expected , says barroso the prospects for economic recovery are looking up , predicts european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .

commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 07.09.2010 ars electronica festival aims to fix a broken world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ars electronica festival 2010 is being held this year at the tabakfabrik in linz , austria .
linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .
you need a lot of brain power and creativity to integrate modern features , such as insulation , into a historic reconstruction . " the city palace has yet to be rebuilt , but with its many historical buildings , germany will have plenty of other opportunities to choose between new and redone . the exhibition " the history of reconstruction ; the construction of history " at the pinakothek in munich currently examines societies ' decisions to rebuild valuable buildings which had been damaged by time or war .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view . " reconstructions are legitimate buildings projects and have always been a significant need for many peoples and nations , " said kuke .
" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .
you need a lot of brain power and creativity to integrate modern features , such as insulation , into a historic reconstruction . " the city palace has yet to be rebuilt , but with its many historical buildings , germany will have plenty of other opportunities to choose between new and redone . the exhibition " the history of reconstruction ; the construction of history " at the pinakothek in munich currently examines societies ' decisions to rebuild valuable buildings which had been damaged by time or war .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .
" why is it such a problem now if we take up just 150 thousand square meters to erect something that matches this historic location ? " bildunterschrift : dresden 's church of our lady , pictured in 1990 , underwent 10 years of reconstruction and reopened in 1999 brain power and creativity the vice-chairman of the association planning to reconstruct the potsdam city palace , hans-joachim kuke , holds a similar view .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .

hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .

hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .

conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .
reconstructions have been carried out many times over the ages , he says , and no one is really interested in the fact that the bell tower of st mark 's basilica in venice is a reconstruction of the original . " since the fall of the berlin wall , six million square meters have been allocated to berlin 's modern constructions , " said von boddien .

" after all , communities are not prepared to give up buildings that are important to their identities . " kuke believes that reconstructing a building 's facade according to the original , but redoing the inside , is also a legitimate approach .
" a facade is incredibly important , " argued kuke , adding that most people probably would not want to use an old-fashioned toilet that was reconstructed according to the original design . " a reconstruction is a highly artistic project - i do n't understand why it 's often dismissed like this .

but as the buildings age , germany continues to be faced with a difficult question : rebuild them just as they were , or put something new in their place . for wilhelm von boddien , grappling with the issue of reconstruction is part of a day 's work .
he is the manager of the association for the rebuilding of the historic berlin city palace , which was largely destroyed by allied bombing in world war ii and completely demolished in 1950 by east german authorities . von boddien 's stance has made him a target for the project 's many opponents , who believe it is too expensive and too unnecessarily fixated on the past .
although the german parliament decided in favor of the reconstruction in 2007 , work on the palace has been delayed until 2014 due to budget cuts , sparking even more debate about the merit of such a project .
for von boddien , the value of the project is clear .
" what do people look at when they 're on vacation and sightseeing in cities ?
they first go to see the historic areas and not some soulless modern constructions , " he said . berlin 's museum island , where the city palace is located , is historically significant in itself .
it is home to the old museum , completed in 1828 , the old national gallery , opened in 1876 , and the berlin cathedral from the turn of the 20th century .
but according to von boddien , this can not compensate for the absence of the city palace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von boddien says tourists want to see historic buildings " the palace may not be everything , but without it , everything is nothing , " explained von boddien , pointing to what he sees as a void in the island 's historical composition . emotional decisions ursula schirmer from the german foundation for monument protection has some doubts .
in her opinion , a reconstructed palace is basically a new building that is financed by public money .
she said that when it comes to allocating money , some older buildings needing restoration not stand a chance against the city palace , simply because they are not spectacular enough . schirmer is not sure whether the highly controversial demolition of the palace of the republic - which was built under the east german regime on the site of the former berlin city palace - was the right decision , as it was a " political " one . " from the perspective of monument protection , this is a questionable matter - we 're still too close to it emotionally , " said schirmer .
" it takes a few generations before an objective decision can be made .
but such a time frame is simply not considered in the case of some buildings . " carl zillich from bundesstiftung baukultur - an organization that monitors the relationship between construction in public space and quality of life - said that " every era should leave behind its own impressive architecture and not foster an architectural still-stand . " however , there does not seem to be a consensus on the side of the investors .
" money for the reconstruction of historic buildings can be obtained far more easily than for well-designed new projects , " commented zillich . overcoming traumas according to zillich , most reconstructions and restorations in germany were decided on " in the heat of the moment " and were meant to help overcome the trauma of the destruction suffered during world war ii .
one prominent example is dresden 's church of our lady , although in contrast to the berlin city place it was reconstructed using original remaining materials . wilhelm von boddien , however , can not understand all the hype surrounding the issue of authenticity .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .

the match-up against azerbaijan , ranked 105th in the world , was an easy win for the germans , in contrast to last friday 's narrow 1-0 victory over belgium .
the win gives coach joachim loew 's side six points , and germany now lead group a on goal difference .
substitute heiko westermann scored germany 's first goal in the 28th minute , with lukas podolski and miroslav klose adding to that count shortly before the half .
azerbaijan were able to knock one in shortly after the half , but an own goal by rashad sadygou and two more by klose and holger badstuber secured the win for germany .
klose 's two goals brought the striker 's international goal count to 55 , making him germany 's joint second-highest goal scorer of all time , 12 behind the all-time record scorer gerd mueller .
' a different level ' " the team produced some more top football and some of the combinations worked very well , " said loew , who will coach the team through to the euro 2012 finals in the ukraine and poland .
" we have been working on things since even before the world cup . you can sense that things are becoming automatic now , " he added .
a disappointed bertie vogts , azerbaijan 's coach and formerly the german national coach , said the end result was acceptable .
" the result is ok , but we gave away some stupid late goals , " he said .
" germany play at a different level to us . "
germany next face turkey in berlin on october 8 , in what could prove a difficult match .
turkey also have a 100 percent record after two games , beating belgium 3-2 in istanbul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.09.2010 eu members agree to submit future budgets to brussels for scrutiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to keep the euro 's value out of the sewers as member states continue spending beyond their means , the eu has agreed to set up a watchdog to monitor national budgets .
the plan is to keep control of borrowing levels and prevent future debt crises . starting next year , the 27 european union members will have to submit their proposed budgets to the eu in advance , so that brussels can srutinize their plans before they take effect .
european finance ministers agreed on tuesday to this new method , designed to prevent individual countries racking up excessive levels of debt , at a special meeting in brussels .
" the initiative will allow the economic and budgetary policies of the member states to be monitored in parallel during a six-month period every year , starting in 2011 , so as to detect any inconsistencies and emerging imbalances , " an official joint statement said .
the plan is to create what amounts to a new budget watchdog or financial peer review , which the eu has dubbed a " european semester . "
the most famous european example of irresponsible fiscal policy is greece , a country which for years submitted false financial data to brussels while its public debt careered out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's debt crisis and rescue package highlights a broader european problem these problems , coupled with the realization that the situation in a host of european countries was little better , led to a stark devaluation of the european single currency , the euro , and the hasty formation of emergency funds designed to protect the eurozone from a debt-triggered currency collapse .
scheduling disputes some eu members , most notably britain , had been reticent to agree to a deal that might be considered an encroachment on national sovereignty .
the british government signed on once the deadlines were revised to ensure that interim budgets could first be presented to national parliament before being sent to brussels .
under the new system , eu members would agree on the main economic challenges facing the bloc in march and recommend some generalized policy ideas .
in april , each state would then revise its existing budget strategies to reconcile them with these guidelines .
then , in a final step taking place through june and july , the european commission and the council of member states would " provide policy advice before the member states finalize their budgets for the following year , " according to the statement .
officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .
the assembled finance ministers also agreed on a plan to implement pan-european watchdogs as of 2011 to oversee banks , insurers and the financial sector , designed to work alongside existing national regulators .
in the event of disagreement , these new european financial sheriffs would outrank their national counterparts .
the eu is seeking to shore up the bloc 's economy against future recessions or financial crises , and to keep member states ' levels of borrowing under control .
most eu members currently have annual budget deficits which exceed the prescribed limit of three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , and overall national debts higher than the supposed maximum of 60 percent of gdp .

officials in brussels , however , stressed that the monitoring procedure would not allow the eu to overrule the decisions of national parliaments , meaning that the final decision would still remain with national governments .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "

developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .

not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .

but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .

developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .

one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .

refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .

" what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

municipal utilities have said the longer lifespans for nuclear power plants could cost them billions of euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuke deal threatens alternative energies , local utilities say ' a nail in the coffin for renewable energy ' albert filbert , head of the city of darmstadt 's hse energy utility , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the capacity utilization of his power plants would drop significantly because of the government 's nuclear deal .
filbert said that the average 12-year lifespan extension would cost municipal electricity suppliers 4.5 billion euros .
frankfurt mayor petra roth , who heads the german municipalities association , said that cities and their utility companies had invested heavily in environmentally-friendly energy generation .
" longer lifespans without compensation only improves the competitive position of the large energy suppliers , " roth said .
roth added that the government 's planned nuclear fuel rod tax , which berlin says will bring in an extra 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- from nuclear plant operators , would cost municipalities an estimated 300 million euros annually in lost business taxes .
hermann albers , president of germany 's national wind energy association , called the nuclear power deal the " final nail in the coffin for renewable energies and wind power . "

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .

many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

the strike coincided with the presentation of the new bill in parliament . tuesday 's mass protests against french president nicolas sarkozy 's planned pension reforms were even larger than similar demonstrations in june .
the strike organizers estimated that 2.5 million people turned out at rallies in major cities across the country , opposing the plans to gradually increase the country 's retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
the french interior ministry , however , disagreed with the cfdt trade union 's figures , estimating instead that 1.12 million people had hit the streets .
in either case , this represents an increased turnout when compared to the last national pensions protest in june .
" after today it 's in the government 's hands , " the leader of the large cfdt union , francois chereque , told rtl radio .
" if they want things to get better , they had better come up with proposals -lsb- for changes to the reform -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retirement , or ' retraite , ' has been a divisive political issue for decades opinion polls suggest that two-thirds of voters oppose sarkozy 's plan , which the president has described as an " absolute priority , " to raise the retirement age by two years and make people work longer for their state pensions .
however , two-thirds of french voters also believe that the protests will not make any difference .
" if we do n't get a hearing , there will be further steps to this mobilization , " the head of the major cgt trade union , bernard thibault , warned on europe 1 radio .
" nothing has been ruled out . "
exploitation , or expediency ?
sarkozy 's center-right ump party , however , says that the planned pension reform is necessary and that it will not back down .
the rallies were organized to coincide with the presentation of the new bill in parliament .
initial discussions on the proposal , which is slated to be introduced in october , began on tuesday afternoon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at around 34 percent , sarkozy 's approval ratings have hit an all time low the government argues that the bill is crucial to help reduce france 's public deficit , which , at eight percent of gdp , is far higher than eurozone targets .
by 2030 , the ump says , the increased retirement age would save france 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 90 billion -rrb- .
" if we do n't act then the deficit in the pension system will hit 20 billion euros in 2010 , 45 billion in 2020 and probably 70 billion euros in 2030 , " warned the leader of the ump in the national assembly , jean-francois cope , in an interview with the major newspaper le figaro , " all the reports conclude that we 're heading into this dead-end , and all the other european countries have faced up to this by raising their legal retirement age to 65 , or even to 67 in places like germany , scandinavia and spain . "
even if increased to 62 , france 's retirement age would remain below the average of around 64 across the oecd 's group of wealthy democracies - in a country with one of the world 's longest life expectancies .
french workers are some of the most productive in the world on an hour-by-hour basis , and they pay relatively high contributions to social security .
the left-leaning opposition , which lowered the retirement age to 60 under president francois mitterrand in the 1980s , accuses sarkozy of protecting his earlier tax cuts for the rich by making the middle and working classes pay for the pensions shortfall .
travel chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a skeleton rail service remained operational tuesday 's strikes hit the french transport sector heavily .
the national rail network sncf announced that 40 percent of all scheduled high-speed tgv trains , and as few as one in four regional trains , were operating as scheduled .
international rail services were also affected , with no trains travelling from france to spain or italy .
also , the french civil aviation authority asked airlines to suspend one-quarter of their flights departing from paris ' two main airports , charles de gaulle and orly .
the strikes also disrupted french schools , the postal service , public radio and television , and were likely to keep most national newspapers off the stands on wednesday .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

overnight trains , both domestic and international , were canceled , according to german news agency dpa , and transportation throughout the country is expected to be severely disrupted as the strike continues into tuesday .
sncf , the state railway operator , said fewer than half of all its high-speed tgv trains would be operating tuesday , and as few as one-in-four regional trains .
international train schedules were also to be affected , with travel to germany curtailed , and spain and italy completely cut off .
however , eurostar trains between paris and london are scheduled to run normally . commuters in paris are also being told to expect delays on the metro , and the french civil aviation authority has asked airlines to suspend 25 percent of their flights from the capital 's two major airports .
the strike wo n't just be limited to transportation .
widespread disruptions are expected in government , industry , banking and postal services .
the education ministry said nearly a third of primary school teachers would be joining the picket line .

recent polls have shown that about 70 percent of the french people support the protests .
the demonstrations are planned to coincide with the start of a debate in parliament over a plan to overhaul the country 's money-losing pension system .
among the proposals from sarkozy 's conservative ump party are plans to gradually raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 .
with people living longer , the government insists that reforms are essential to shore up the pension program .
despite the strikes , protests and travel delays , sarkozy is expected to remain firm .
according to french media reports , the government is not prepared to make any concessions , apart from enlarging the list of professions that will be exempt from the reform because of their effect on workers ' health .
france is facing a huge public deficit , and the government thinks raising the retirement age could save 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 89.7 billion -rrb- by 2030 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .

the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 07.09.2010 ars electronica festival aims to fix a broken world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ars electronica festival 2010 is being held this year at the tabakfabrik in linz , austria .
linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .
ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .
thanks a lot for sharing this year 's ars electronica with us , sruthi !
anytime , cyrus .

ok , i 'm definitely going to poke around on diaspora when it comes out .

linz , austria 's annual tech-art show features an artist fixing buildings with legos , and a facebook rival .
jan vormann plugs lego pieces into wall cracks while maxwell salzberg , an american programmer , outlines diaspora . ars electronica is a digital media and art festival currently going on in linz , austria .
the 31st annual event will conclude this saturday , september 11 .
since its debut over thirty years ago , it 's been a creative forum for design , art and technology .
last year , there were all kinds of strange items , including a do-it-yourself-kit that converts urine into fertilizer for your houseplants .
this past weekend , deutsche welle 's sruthi pinnamaneni went to ars and came back to tell us what eyebrow-raising ideas she came across .
deutsche welle : so , sruthi , what going on at this year 's ars festival ?
sruthi pinnamaneni : hey cyrus .
i did n't quite find something that stacks up to that pee converter that you found last year .
this year 's festival seems to have taken a turn towards the tamer side . the theme was ' repair , ' and the curators tried to bring together a number of artists , scientists and business people to fix what has been broken in the world : the economy , the environment , our society .
that 's quite a modest goal for a week-long festival .
definitely .
and it took place in an appropriately apocalyptic space .
this year 's venue is the tabakfabrik , an abandoned tobacco processing plant whose hulking complex was built in the 30s by german and austrian architects .
it 's a symphony in communist brown and turquoise blue , and is full of holes and widening cracks - which made it the perfect repair ground for jan vormann . he 's a street artist and sculpture student from berlin , whose hobby it is to cover the missing tiles and cracks on the surfaces of buildings using : lego blocks .
are you serious – lego blocks ? serious .
jan has left his trail of lego corrections in berlin , tel aviv , new york and several other cities .
when i found him at ars , he was crouched near a spot with missing tiles , carefully fitting lego blocks over the open area .
he told me about his inspiration , which strangely enough comes from old , rustic italy .
here 's how vormann explained it to me .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan vormann uses lego blocks to patch up cracks and crumbling corners jan vormann : the idea was in bocignan in an italy , it was a beautiful city , where the needs were stronger than the aesthetic . the people used to build with the stone that they had . they fixed old roman walls with brick and plaster . it is all mixed up like patchwork .
the idea was .
this is a possibility to do something outside without coming in conflict with the law because of this positive repair aspect . hang on , so this guy is actually repairing bits of wall with legos ?
are they strong enough to withstand big , modern walls ?
let me explain something – the legos are purely visual surface repairs .
almost like a patch sewn onto a pair of jeans .
they do n't actually hold up anything .
oh , ok .
i was going to say .
still though , it sounds pretty cool .
after all , when you use lego blocks for example - then the repair becomes part of the story of whatever it is that 's broken .
right , that 's exactly the point .
now , the repair theme at ars extended beyond the physical world , and into the online world .
in fact , there was something at ars where programmers and panelists were not asking for a repair - rather they were screaming that the thing be thrown out and an all-new replacement found .
ok , so what was it ?
facebook .
facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
what 's wrong with facebook ?
c 'mon .
lots of people worldwide - especially where you are in germany - have plenty of questions about its privacy policy , and they want to know how the company is sharing their data .
so to find out more , i spoke to maxwell salzberg , who along with three fellow new york university students , created what they say could be a secure , personally controlled , open-source version of the social network .
it 's called diaspora .
right , i 've been hearing a lot of discussion online about diaspora in the last few months . back in april , they put out a call for funding on a website that helps people find money for projects . they asked for $ 10,000 -lrb- 7,800 euros -rrb- and in no time , they raised more than $ 200,000 -lrb- 156,000 euros -rrb- .
heck , even mark zuckerberg himself , the founder of facebook , donated some money .
right , and that initial $ 10,000 was supposed to be enough money to sustain them on ramen noodles and pizza while they coded through the summer . they still seem shocked at how much they raised with so little effort .
salzberg explained to me why they decided to pour their student energy into diaspora : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxwell salzberg is one of the founders of diaspora , a new open-source alternative to facebook maxwell salzberg : facebook is this weird thing .
you give up so much for something that 's ultimately not some sort of technological marvel . it has no notion of your privacy and they have shown again and again that they are willing to change your defaults and their goal is to make the internet more open , whether you actually want that or not . it 's weird that we 're in a place where there 's no good alternative . if you 're willing to be a tin-foil hat and you want to be on a social network , there 's nowhere to go , even for geeks and hackers , which is just an anomaly of technology because there 's usually a glut of any idea .
i like that " tin-foil hat " label . but how does diaspora work ? say i 'm a tin-foil hat but i also want to be part of an online community - why would diaspora be a better option than other social networks ?
i mean , why should i trust diaspora over facebook , or any other social network ?
social networks like facebook direct all your data to a central hub that they own . the idea behind diaspora is that users install their own " seeds . " the diaspora guys chose the word " seed " because it 's cuter and less scary than " server , " but essentially this means users will have their own server where they fully control what information they share with other users . this seed is combined with the idea of group functionality , which means that when you add friends to your network , you must choose what group or " context " they belong to . in a way it 's simple .
the diaspora model is a radical shift from what we ’ ve become used to with social networks .
facebook , for instance , works on a service-agreement model where it says you can use its community-sharing platform , but in exchange for that , it can put its hands into your data .
diaspora , on the other hand , does not want to host people 's data ; rather , it would push you to host your own data or engage in a hosting agreement with a party of your choice .
in other words , users would opt for a relationship similar to the one with their electricity company - the company provides a service -lrb- in this case , hosting -rrb- but can not touch the data or see what users do with it .
it ’ s a blackbox model .
and how would they make money ? do they charge a monthly fee like the electricity company ?
am i going to have to pay for diaspora ?
good question . at this stage , they are not sure . but on september 15th - that 's next wednesday - they will release the source code for diaspora . and that will begin the long process of testing the concepts and adding functionality . they are a ways away from challenging the big boys .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

but he warns member states against reliving europe 's dark history with respect to minority rights . in his first state of the union address to the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday , european commission president jose manuel barroso was upbeat about a swift economic recovery in the 27-nation bloc .
he said the eu 's executive was confident that growth would be significantly higher than originally forecast only a few months ago .
the latest official forecasts put growth in the eu at 1.0 percent in 2010 and 0.9 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro common currency .
upwardly revised forecasts are expected to be announced later this month .
barroso urged the bloc to accelerate structural reforms over the next 12 months that he hopes will make europe 's economy greener , more competitive and more socially inclusive .
" europe must show that it 's more than 27 different national solutions .
we either swim together , or sink separately , " he said .
barroso argued that , if europe joins closer together , it will be able to exert more political power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is now looking to tackle abuses on financial markets but members of the european parliament reacted with incredulity , pointing out the weakness of europe 's political clout .
" how can we justify our absence from the washington peace talks between israelis and palestinians , while at the same time we are the biggest donor in the region ? " asked joseph daul , leader of the christian democratic group . xenophobic ghosts of europe 's past when barroso began to talk about minority rights , aimed at the expulsion of the roma in france , the audience came alive with sounds of approval .
" everyone in europe must respect the law and the governments must respect human rights including those of minorities , " barroso said .
" racism and xenophobia have no place in europe .
on such sensitive issues and when a problem arises we must all act with responsibility .
i make a strong appeal not to reawaken the ghosts of europe 's past . "
criticism came from european parliamentarians .
martin schulz , leader of the socialists in the european parliament , criticized barroso for his indirectness , saying that he had failed to defend basic eu rights .
" i would have liked you to have clearly named the government of nicolas sarkozy . " helene flautre , from the french greens , accused barroso of playing down the issue .
" france has violated eu laws with the collective expulsion of roma groups , including their children .
the commission should finally make this crystal clear , " she said .
commission president relaunches ' eurobond ' idea barroso told eu parliamentarians that he would field new proposals by the end of this month to tackle some of the actions of market speculators , whom many have blamed for exacerbating the global financial crisis .
in his address , barroso also proposed creating a joint european bond to finance major infrastructure projects .
" pooling money at the european level allows member states to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment , " he said .
so-called " eurobonds " have long been favored by eu federalists eager to give the bloc more state-like powers , including the ability to raise cash on the bond market .
but they are viewed with suspicion by fiscal hawks and those opposed to further eu integration .

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

the raids took place in the five states of rhineland-palatinate , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine westphalia , lower saxony and berlin they were organized by the interior ministry as part of an ongoing examination of the legality of hng and similar right-wing organizations .
according to a statement issued by interior ministry official klaus-dieter fritsche , the group 's official objective is to support incarcerated neo-nazi members and their families , in an effort to " strengthen and overcome the ideological struggles in the fragmented neo-nazi scene . "
" we suspect that the actions of the hng do not conform to our constitution and that they threaten the cohesion of society , " fritsche added .
" today 's searches will show if these suspicions are confirmed . "
help for prisoners - to ' hold onto convictions ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer and fewer germans are joining right-wing groups the interior ministry suspects that the hng is not only concerned with supporting neo-nazi prisoners , but rather with preventing them from abandoning their ideologies while incarcerated .
a german government report dating back to 2001 said the group was involved in of a number of non-constitutional activities , most notably the dissemination of nazi propaganda and the use of nazi and other far-right extremist symbols .
some 600 people belong to the hng network , which has been in existence for over three decades , the interior ministry said .
at present , the group supports between 100 and 200 prisoners in germany .
members visit convicts and provide them with far-right extremist literature , among other things .
not every neo-nazi who lands in prison in germany , however , is chosen by the hng to receive the group 's support .
only notorious far-right extremists - or those who committed a widely-recognized crime - make the list , which is published in the group 's monthly magazine .
' crucial period of reflection ' the hng strives to " make martyrs " out of prominent incarcerated neo-nazis , according to bernd wagner , who heads exit-deutschland , a group which lends support to neo-nazis looking to abandon their beliefs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are given time to reflect in prison , wagner said " when prominent members get sent to prison for committing violent acts , the -lsb- hng -rsb- portrays them as martyrs for the greater far-right cause , " wagner told deutsche welle .
" this is for two reasons : first , it keeps the prisoners believing and fighting against the system .
second , it spreads interest in the scene in the free world outside of prison .
this is crucial for the right wing scene , because it is losing momentum . "
indeed , the number of far-right radicals in germany is dropping .
the country 's internal security agency published a report in 2009 saying that some 5,000 people belonged to the far-right scene , which showed a decrease of several hundred compared to 2008 and previous years .
wagner 's group , exit-deutschland , is in direct competition with the hng .
he says prison is a crucial time for many neo-nazis to " reflect on their actions and their criminality . "
" as a group , we are there to help neo-nazis who want to change their ways .
we deal with many prisoners , which makes us a threat for the purposes of the hng .
they want to keep their members , naturally , and we are there just to give these people the assurance that it is possible to live a different life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.09.2010 cybercrime in germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke says survey data about cybercrime can be deceptive a new study estimates that germany will lose 17 million euros to phishing by the end of 2010 .
law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

law enforcement officials seek more access to personal data online while civil libertarians have called for more privacy . with virus programs , data theft , and credit card fraud ever more present – cybercrime in germany is constantly increasing .
that 's the conclusion of a new joint study published monday by the german information technology trade group , bitkom and the federal criminal police office , also known by its german acronym , bka .
phishing in germany on the rise according to their new study , the two groups estimate that there will be around 5,000 phishing cases in germany by the end of the year .
phishing occurs when internet users are fooled into giving up personal information , usually on fraudulent websites designed to look like legitimate platforms .
they add that this represents a 70 percent increase over last year .
the study also states that the average financial loss for each phishing incident is around 3,500 euros and that the total sum of money lost to phishing for the whole country in 2010 will be about 17 million euros .
despite these alarming figures , dieter kempf , a bitkom board member , said that this data can be deceptive .
" the fear of becoming a victim is usually greater than the actual risk , " he said .
" that said , two thirds of german web users have already had real-life experience with internet crime .
but it was mostly traditional virus attacks that were reported to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziercke expects that social networks like facebook will be targeted by online criminals despite the increase of these kinds of online attacks , the president of the federal criminal police office , joerg ziercke , expects that smartphones and social networks such as facebook or xing will also become targets of future criminal activity .
" the perpetrators expect mail attachments opened in social networks will have more success because the recipients think that they are coming from a known sender , " he said .
law enforcement hampered but beyond clever tactics , german authorities say , there 's another big reason why the fight against computer crime is tough .
a german court ruled earlier this year ruled that national laws designed to comply with the european union data retention directive were unconstitutional .
the directive would require all member states to store telecommunications data for between six to 24 months , including the ip address and the times of every email , phone call and text message .
so far , romania and germany are the only two of the 27 member states to declare it unlawful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy advocates have called for greater anonymity online but law enforcement officials like joerg ziercke also stress the advantages of being able to hang on to this kind of data .
" due to the fact that internet providers are no longer required to store such data , there 's a chance that police authorities will not be able to acquire relevant suspicious criminal data to conduct investigations , " he said .
ziercke called on german lawmakers to draw up new legislation based on these findings .
but even if law enforcement did have better access to ip addresses - the individual number for a given device on the internet at a given time - they 're so fluid that it may not even make a difference .
" if you have a vehicle plate number , we can ask the federal motor vehicle registry to determine who owns that vehicle .
but in the world of it crime , when we investigate an ip address , we can never know for sure who is behind that ip address . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.09.2010 opinion : western aid and south-south cooperation : learning together ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development policy could be in for a shift away from the traditionally big players the development aid landscape is changing as non-western donor countries step in – and often , work in step .
the west could learn something from these new players , argue commentators axel berger and sven grimm . many newly industrializing countries are becoming , like western donors , active in development policy - and increasingly so .
these new ' southern ' donors , from china and india to brazil and south africa , are appearing on the world stage at a time when the western donor community is working hard to live up to its commitments in the developing world .
the yardstick for this is the 2005 paris declaration , an agreement between donor and recipient countries designed to increase the effectiveness of the aid .
many fear that the growing commitment of the new donors could endanger the standards of western development policy , since these donors ' south-south cooperation follows non-western principles and mechanisms .
it 's against this background that we ask ourselves : is cooperation between traditional and new donors possible and appropriate , and is it for the good of poorer developing countries ?
perhaps both groups have something to learn from one another .
south-south cooperation in focus the ' new ' donors – many have been supporting poorer developing countries for decades – view their aid as different from western development aid .
they see their growing commitment as more than a simple financial move , and they link their aid to trade preferences and the promotion of foreign direct investments among their companies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spirit of south-south development aid : mutual benefit , not just a handout from the southern donor perspective , the link between aid and investment answers the question of effectiveness : " we managed to better establish our companies in the recipient country – thus the aid was effective . "
mutual benefit , not altruism , defines this kind of commitment .
this principle of south-south cooperation , in which aid is used to promote development in both donor and recipient countries , has been held in high regard by developing countries since the conference of non-aligned states in bandung in 1955 .
yet this does not give a clear definition of south-south cooperation .
it is hard to say at what point export promotion becomes true cooperation , providing a truly mutual benefit .
from development aid to a global development policy however , a new conversation about the significance of development cooperation beyond the paris agenda is obviously needed in the ' north ' as well .
several leading african economists have caused a stir with calls for an end to development aid , and former french development agency head jean-michel severino is now calling for the " end of oda " in the midst of efforts to find a shift of emphasis of development policy .
this should not be understood as capitulation in the face of the challenges , severino has said , but as part of a shift in thinking about aid .
relationships between donors and recipients – whether north-south or south-south – are always characterized by inequality : one gives and the other takes .
increasingly , countries from the south are rejecting this basic philosophy .
once the millennium development goals deadline passes in 2015 , the aim must be to place the creation of global development partnerships at the centre of the discussion .
these development partnerships should enable joint contributions to the creation of public goods such as peace and a clean environment .
aid alone is not enough ; the partnerships must be broader .
since this can not be accomplished without the large newly industrializing countries , they should be consulted on the possible forms , content and standards of such cooperation .
trilateral cooperation as a way to a joint goal ?
trilateral or triangular cooperation – that is , cooperation with new donors in a further developing country – is the subject of intense discussion at present , not least because such cooperation also allows the west some influence over the behaviour of countries like china , india or brazil in developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some leading african economists have made the controversial call for an end to development aid the greatest potential of trilateral cooperation lies in the fact that it can serve as a strategic bridge between western development policy and south-south cooperation .
in practice , however , there are only a few small-scale projects , above all with latin-american countries such as mexico or chile , in third countries of the region .
to date , china and india have shown little interest in three-way cooperation , since it is regarded as a vehicle by which the west attempts to export its standards .
western donors , on the other hand , emphasize advantages of trilateral cooperation such as reduced costs , joint learning and the opportunity to make use of the specific knowledge of the partners .
at the same time , trilateral cooperation can not be expected to automatically lead to more effective aid : indeed , the large number of small-scale projects is problematic , according to current effectiveness criteria .
in view of the already widespread skepticism of the new donors towards the paris agenda – seen by many as a western trojan horse – ' paris ' should not set the tone of the debate .
the north-south opposition is not inevitable , as was shown by an international exchange on the potential of trilateral cooperation in august this year .
that exchange took place as part of the global governance school at the deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- german development institute , or die -rrb- and was attended by researchers and practitioners from china , india , brazil , south arica and other newly industrializing countries .
joint discussions and the conduct of specific research cooperation between die and chinese , indian or south african partners lead to new perspectives on both sides .
trilateral cooperation is not a one-way street , through which the emerging donors are “ integrated ” in order to conform to our standards .
if the global partnerships are to be effective , we must overcome the old north-south thinking , which too often still sets the tone of debate .
joint problem solutions must be the central focus here , and this must occur between partners with different experiences on equal terms .
both sides , north and south , must attempt to learn from and maybe even with each other in the interest of developing countries .
this column reflects the opinions of the authors .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .

the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 07.09.2010 karstadt deal may be too late to save iconic chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt stores need millions of euros in renovations germany 's iconic karstadt department store chain is saved for now , but there is reasonable cause to doubt the company 's future in its current form .
its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .

another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .

" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .

their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .

it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .

now , natural alternatives are helping to make refrigeration greener . supermarket manager thomas knopp likes nothing more than talking about his store 's new climate-friendly refrigerators and freezers . " what makes them so innovative is that our cooling systems run on natural gas and are completely chemicals-free , " he says proudly .
he 's not talking about a supermarket in a country with a reputation as an environmental trailblazer .
knopp does n't work in germany or japan but for the ' pick n pay ' chain in cape town , south africa .
the company has installed state-of-the-art , climate-friendly freezers in two of its outlets .
these rely not on standard synthetic refrigerants such as cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- and hcfcs -lrb- hydrofluorocarbons -rrb- , but co2 , a far less environmentally-damaging natural refrigerant .
but as everyone these days is well aware , carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming .
so how come it 's now being hailed as an environmentally-friendly coolant ? it sounds paradoxical to the layman , but experts agree that co2 is the answer to green refrigeration in supermarkets – the reason being that as a natural gas that can be " borrowed " from the carbon cycle , it is climate-neutral : supermarkets using co2 are not adding to greenhouse gases in the environment .
in contrast , standard fluorocarbons such as cfcs are molecules constructed to act as refrigerants , among other things .
their impact on the environment is measured by their global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- .
the gwp is how much a given mass of greenhouse gas is estimated to contribute to global warming .
it is a relative scale which compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of carbon dioxide -lrb- whose gwp is by convention equal to 1 -rrb- .
in some cases , the gwp of fluorocarbons is 100 to 4000 greater than that of co2 .
or , as greenpeace puts it : " just by releasing the 300 grams of refrigerant contained in a domestic fridge the climate impact would equal driving a volkswagen golf from london to moscow . "
dangerous leakage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate-friendly alternatives to standard refrigeration technologies are on the rise the 1987 montreal protocol , signed by almost 200 countries , was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion , such as cfcs and hcfcs .
developing countries were given longer time-frames , with a deadline of 2010 .
but when the industrialized nations phased out ozone-depleting chemicals cfcs and hcfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons , they replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- .
while these do not damage the ozone layer , their global warming potential is significant .
nonetheless , they remain the norm in super ­ market fridges and freezers – including in germany .
one of the biggest problems with these chemicals is leakage .
virtually all cooling systems leak , but because of their smaller molecular structure , hfcs are more prone to leak than cfcs .
this represents thousands of tonnes of emissions , as thomas knopp observed , when he still used his old cooling systems . " with the old systems , up to 30 percent of the cooling agent would leak , " he said .
" there was leakage everywhere , from the pipes to the actual shelves .
now we have no leaks at all . "
refrigerators relying on co2 , meanwhile , withstand a much greater gas pressure than standard refrigeration units .
this means that state-of-the art refrigeration systems are more robust and durable .
as well as requiring fewer refrigerants because they leak less , they are also more energy-efficient .
only a matter of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of cfcs in aerosol spray cans was banned decades ago knopp estimates that his new system uses 25 percent less energy than the one it replaced .
the only downside is the higher manufacturing cost – the main obstacle preventing green refrigeration from going mainstream .
too many supermarkets are put off by the relatively high investment needed to make the switch .
but a further selling-point is the opportunity they afford for waste heat recovery , using waste heat from the refrigeration to heat the store premises or its water supply , for example .
not only does this reduce the supermarket 's carbon footprint , it also reduces its energy consumption .
given these many environmental and economic advantages , it should be only a matter of time before co2 refrigeration systems become standard features in supermarkets . emerging nations and developing countries could , moreover , learn in this instance from the mistakes of the industrialized countries .
while recent decades saw their supermarkets switch to refrigerants that do not damage the ozone layer , in the process introducing a generation of chemicals with a greenhouse effect thousands of times stronger than co2 , chains such as ' pick n pay ' in south africa can leapfrog this stage and go green without further ado . martin schrader , michael wetzel -lrb- jp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

its new owner plans to invest 65 million euros , but more may be needed . although the german department store chain karstadt was rescued from insolvency by a deal finalized on friday , it remains to be seen how billionaire investor nicolas berggruen will bring the company back to life .
many of karstadt 's stores are in dire need of renovation and its workforce is demoralized .
some experts doubt whether department store chains can ever prosper in today 's marketplace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen plans to renovate the stores with a 65 million euro investment the acquisition brings an end to 15 months of uncertainty over the future of the 130-year-old company .
berggruen negotiated extensively with karstadt 's creditors , including valovis bank and the goldman sachs-led highstreet constoritum , which is the landlord of 86 of karstadt 's 120 stores .
friday 's deadline set by an insolvency court in essen had to be extended by 12 hours before the last of highstreet 's more than 100 investors signed off on the deal .
now highstreet is expected to sell all of its karstadt real estate , according to christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician thomas heilmann .
when it will do so depends on market conditions , but it is unlikely to happen within the next two years , he said .
modernization needed berggruen 's initial plans include modernizing karstadt 's operations with a 65 million euro investment .
shopping at karstadt needs to be " current , modern and exciting .
we need more life in our stores , " he told the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
but rainer bartle , a consultant with bbe in munich , said he 's not convinced berggruen 's plans will succeed in making the chain profitable .
after years of financial difficulties , karstadt 's stores wo n't be cheap to renovate , he said , pointing out that the chain would need to invest some 350 million euros to give each outlet a modernization budget of 3 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berggruen had to collect more than 100 signatures to make his purchase " it would cost significantly more than berggruen is willing to invest , " he told deutsche welle .
" it wo n't be enough .
there 's no concept which states what he 's planning . "
another hurdle is coming to terms with the company 's 25,000 employees , who are represented by the powerful verdi trade union .
karstadt has been in dire financial straits for a long time and is sure to have lost many of its best employees , according to bartle .
" at the moment karstadt is completely unappealing as an employer , " he said .
" the company was performing poorly long before it entered insolvency .
and what do employees do in a situation like that ?
they find another job .
those left over either have too much to lose - are senior employees - or they could n't find anything else . "
bartle said he expects berggruen to split the company up and sell parts of it .
possible spin-offs might include the kadewe luxury store in berlin or the company 's 32 karstadt sport stores .
berggruen has said himself he only plans to own karstadt temporarily .
many small companies have made a success of individual department stores in germany 's mid-sized cities , but karstadt 's approach is flawed , bartle said .
the company still devotes large amounts of sales space to multimedia departments , although comparable wares are available for lower prices at electronics chains like saturn or mediamarkt .
" those are things karstadt should have separated itself from a long time ago , " bartle said .
trade union optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt needs to modernize its product range verdi spokeswoman cornelia hass , however , is optimistic that karstadt can be turned around .
she acknowledged investment in the chain has been lacking for some time and said she believes renovation and modernization is absolutely necessary .
" we believe the company can be modernized , and that the company must be modernized , " she told deutsche welle .
" we also believe there is enough space available in the german market .
karstadt 's new owner is not dependent on difficult-to-obtain credit , and so the money needed for new investment will in fact flow . "
in addition to basic structural renovations , karstadt 's stores and sales floors need to be redesigned .
" the simple fact is a lot needs to happen in this next period of time to get investment flowing again , " she said .
" the inventory needs to be looked at and adapted to what customers are looking for .
that 's the main thing now . "

natural alternatives include carbon dioxide . cfcs chlorofluorocarbons are man - made substances containing carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane .
cfcs are largely to blame for the hole in the ozone layer .
the montreal protocol was drawn up in 1987 in response to depletion of the ozone layer over antarctica , and called for a phase-out and ultimate ban of cfcs manufacture .
in germany , cfcs have been banned as refrigerants since the mid-1990s .
global warming potential -lrb- gwp -rrb- is a figure that refers to the amount of global warming caused by a substance : it is the ratio of the warming caused by a substance to the warming caused by a similar mass of carbon dioxide .
the gwp of cfcs is very high .
hcfcs hydrochlorofluorocarbons are man-made compounds containing hydrogen , chlorine , fluorine and carbon .
hcfc production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of cfcs in the 1980s , because they are less harmful to the atmosphere .
hcfcs are less stable in the lower atmosphere , enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer .
however , hcfcs are also very potent greenhouse gases , and have an extremely high gwp .
hfcs hydrofluorocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen , fluorine , and carbon .
hfcs are a class of replacements for cfcs .
because they do not contain chlorine or bromine , they do not deplete the ozone layer .
hfcs are not ozone-toxic and have an ozone depletion potential -lrb- odp -rrb- of 0 .
however , hfcs contribute to the greenhouse effect and have high gwps .
hcs from a chemical point of view , a hydrocarbon is the simplest organic compound , consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon .
hydrocarbons include methane , ethane , propane , cyclopropane , butane , and cyclopentane .
the properties of hcs make them ideal refrigerants .
since hydrocarbons are flammable , some basic safety rules need to be respected by manufacturers , installers and users , which may differ slightly depending on the application .
hcs may offer advantages as substitutes to ozone depleting substances because they are inexpensive to produce and they have an odp of zero , low gwp , and low toxicity .
the most commonly used hc refrigerants are propane -lrb- mainly in commercial and industrial freezers , air conditioning and heat pumps -rrb- , and isobutane -lrb- in domestic refrigerators and freezers -rrb- .
co2 carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas but an excellent refrigerant due to its high cooling capacity .
it is also non-combustible , and available worldwide at low cost in the required qualities .
conventional refrigerants such as hfcs cause about 1,400 times more global warming than the same quantity of carbon dioxide .
co2 has an odp of zero and a negligible gwp .
because of its thermodynamic properties , co2 differs from the other refrigerants and can operate even in extremely low outside temperatures .
co2 is increasingly used in car air-conditioning systems ; supermarket refrigeration units and air conditioning systems .
carbon dioxide has a number of advantages as a refrigerant .
systems using co2 operate at very high pressure .
water and air water and air are natural refrigerants that are non-toxic and widely available .
technologies allowing their wider use as alternative refrigerants are still in development .
although various research projects are underway worldwide , the demanding technology involved remains a challenge in terms of cost and design .

made up of kyle kennedy , liam meers , max newsome and chris cook , the foursome have recently undergone a turn around in the band 's musical direction .
it 's quite a transformation from an exclusively acoustic four piece to a much louder and heavier rock and roll ensemble .
arriving in time for the sound check , i received a warm welcome from the band .
corona radiata were eager to let their fans know about their change of name , image and the general change in direction for the band .
' ultimate thrill ' the guys , formerly known as the westberries , told me that their transformation was " a natural progression " and spoke of how being able to write totally new material and play it for the first time was their " ultimate thrill " .
max showed off the heavier sound by breaking the bass drum pedal !
" no one does rock and roll in its true form anymore so we 're bringing it back , " says kyle .
lead guitarist kyle runs me through the band 's history , " we started as an electric band , became acoustic , then the lord showed us to max . "
their new style allows them to hide behind the sound unlike their acoustic roots .
another plus for the guys , who all grew up together , was being able to play their first gig as corona radiata in blackburn 's new music venue the music factory .
drummer max jokes : " the building is n't there anymore ; we tore it down . "
considering that this was their second gig the band came across as a coherent unit .
the attic 's intimate atmosphere complimented the band 's growing following and the lads interacted with the crowd as well as playing their music to provide the audience with a dynamic performance to watch , rather than simply a gig .
sneaky cover playing mostly original tracks along with one sneaky cover of the who 's ' my generation ' , corona radiata played well and received a warm reception from the crowd .
liam on lead vocals got the crowd involved and appeared at ease in his lead role .
in max 's words he tore the place apart with his passionate and animated drumming .
all in all the gig went well as the crowd grew louder and the empty spaces in the attic were quickly filled with more and more enthusiastic spectators .
to sum up a winning gig that showcased the potential and the talent of this upcoming band . • are you in a band and fancy having your music played on the show ?
all you have to do is upload your tunes to the bbc uploader .
