a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .

" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .

rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 10.04.2010 china faces mounting water shortages and desert expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women carry hay through the growing desert in china 's minqin county german environment minister norbert roettgen is striving to work with china on ecological and climate issues .
he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .

two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

he and his brother jaroslaw were early anti-communism crusaders who went on to draw criticism from liberals . polish president lech kaczynksi will be remembered as a man with traditional values that sharply divided european opinion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.04.2010 sudan faces uncertain future as it goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was hoped the polls would give sudan new democratic legitimacy the credibility of sunday 's elections in sudan has been greatly weakened after several main opposition parties decided to boycott the polls .
eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if the poll is not fair , it looks set to go ahead nonetheless the united states has called on al-bashir to briefly delay the elections until more stability can be ensured .
after a closed-door briefing by the un peacekeeping chief , susan rice , us ambassador to the un , told reporters that " much is awry " with the election process in sudan .
she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .
observers believe that the international community 's real priority is next january 's referendum on possible independence for the south .
with the chance of secession on the horizon , this could also explain , in part , the splm 's willingness to restrict its electoral involvement even if it means letting al-bashir win for now .

eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?

she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .

an investigation is underway . poland 's president lech kaczynski and many of the country 's political elite were among the 97 people killed saturday when their plane crashed outside the city of smolensk , in western russia .
russian officials said the plane hit trees as it came down in thick fog on its approach to the airport , about 275 miles -lrb- 440 kilometers -rrb- southwest of moscow .
television images showed the burning fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest . " the polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing .
tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart , " said sergei antufyev , regional governor of smolensk , on state news channel rossiya-24 .
" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .
black box recovered one of the plane 's flight recorders has been found , and investigations into the crash of the russian-built tupolev tu-154 are underway .
polish justice minister krzysztof kwiatkowski said he would order a special inquiry into the crash , while russian president dmitry medvedev has set up a special commission to investigate the crash , to be headed by prime minister vladimir putin .
the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .

an investigation is underway . poland 's president lech kaczynski and many of the country 's political elite were among the 97 people killed saturday when their plane crashed outside the city of smolensk , in western russia .
russian officials said the plane hit trees as it came down in thick fog on its approach to the airport , about 275 miles -lrb- 440 kilometers -rrb- southwest of moscow .
television images showed the burning fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest . " the polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing .
tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart , " said sergei antufyev , regional governor of smolensk , on state news channel rossiya-24 .
" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .
black box recovered one of the plane 's flight recorders has been found , and investigations into the crash of the russian-built tupolev tu-154 are underway .
polish justice minister krzysztof kwiatkowski said he would order a special inquiry into the crash , while russian president dmitry medvedev has set up a special commission to investigate the crash , to be headed by prime minister vladimir putin .
the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoegstroem -lrb- right -rrb- denies the charges against him five other men have also been arrested in connection with the auschwitz theft , and three have been tried and sentenced to terms of between 18 months to two and a half years .
two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .

mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland is scheduled to hold early presidential elections before the end of june . lech kaczynski was running for reelection , with his main rival being parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski , the man who has now become acting president . observers say it is hard to predict how quickly the main opposition conservative law and justice party , led by kaczynski ’ s twin brother , can gather its forces considering that many of its leaders were among the crash victims . author : rafael kiepuszewski editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

bildunterschrift : kaczynski was in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre " we still can not fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future .
nothing like this has ever happened in poland , " said piotr paszkowski , spokesman for poland 's foreign ministry .
polish prime minister donald tusk called the crash poland 's " most tragic event in post-war history . "
tusk will travel to the crash site where he will meet prime minister putin .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .

walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 10.04.2010 kaczynski : a ' combative ' patriot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski was elected president in 2005 polish president lech kaczynski was a " combative european " and a patriot .
saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .

the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .

he was to visit katyn , near smolensk , to commemorate both russian and polish victims . initial reports suggested that as many as 132 people had been on board , but that number has since been revised to 96 .
passengers included kaczynski 's wife maria , leading historians and several of poland 's high-ranking officials , among them the chief of poland 's military franciszek gagor , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer and central bank governor slawomir skrzypek .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 10.04.2010 china faces mounting water shortages and desert expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women carry hay through the growing desert in china 's minqin county german environment minister norbert roettgen is striving to work with china on ecological and climate issues .
he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

a week of national mourning was declared by the speaker of the polish parliament and now caretaker president bronislaw komorowski . “ we are united in the face of this great national tragedy ” he said . polish prime minister donald tusk conveyed condolences to the family of president kaczynski , including his twin brother jaroslaw , the former prime minister , and to the families of the other crash victims . he is scheduled to fly to the site of the disaster .

he died on a mission to remember the suffering of the polish nation during world war two , " one elderly woman said , her voice heavy with emotion .
she was referring to the ceremony kaczynski was en route to commemorating the 1940 massacre of polish soldiers by the soviets . “ i was not among his supporters and i often disagreed with his nationalist and ultraconservative views , but this is a huge loss ” was the reaction of a young warsaw university student . his legacy poles appear sharply divided in their assessment of kaczynski ’ s legacy .

among kaczynski ’ s controversial moves was the banning of a gay pride parade in warsaw at a time when he served as the city 's mayor .
among the victims of the plane crash were many high-profile members of the polish political establishment : a deputy foreign minister , several key national security advisors , the chief of staff , the president of the national bank of poland and the ombudsman . “ it is an irreparable blow to the national elite , ” former president aleksander kwasniewski said .
poland is scheduled to hold early presidential elections before the end of june . lech kaczynski was running for reelection , with his main rival being parliamentary speaker bronislaw komorowski , the man who has now become acting president . observers say it is hard to predict how quickly the main opposition conservative law and justice party , led by kaczynski ’ s twin brother , can gather its forces considering that many of its leaders were among the crash victims . author : rafael kiepuszewski editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 10.04.2010 china faces mounting water shortages and desert expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women carry hay through the growing desert in china 's minqin county german environment minister norbert roettgen is striving to work with china on ecological and climate issues .
he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

an investigation is underway . poland 's president lech kaczynski and many of the country 's political elite were among the 97 people killed saturday when their plane crashed outside the city of smolensk , in western russia .
russian officials said the plane hit trees as it came down in thick fog on its approach to the airport , about 275 miles -lrb- 440 kilometers -rrb- southwest of moscow .
television images showed the burning fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest . " the polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing .
tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart , " said sergei antufyev , regional governor of smolensk , on state news channel rossiya-24 .
" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .
black box recovered one of the plane 's flight recorders has been found , and investigations into the crash of the russian-built tupolev tu-154 are underway .
polish justice minister krzysztof kwiatkowski said he would order a special inquiry into the crash , while russian president dmitry medvedev has set up a special commission to investigate the crash , to be headed by prime minister vladimir putin .
the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .
major delegation kaczynski was traveling to russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre , the murder of thousands of prisoners of war under soviet leader josef stalin during world war ii .
he was to visit katyn , near smolensk , to commemorate both russian and polish victims . initial reports suggested that as many as 132 people had been on board , but that number has since been revised to 96 .
passengers included kaczynski 's wife maria , leading historians and several of poland 's high-ranking officials , among them the chief of poland 's military franciszek gagor , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer and central bank governor slawomir skrzypek .
bildunterschrift : kaczynski was in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre " we still can not fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future .
nothing like this has ever happened in poland , " said piotr paszkowski , spokesman for poland 's foreign ministry .
polish prime minister donald tusk called the crash poland 's " most tragic event in post-war history . "
tusk will travel to the crash site where he will meet prime minister putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .
three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .
after the 19-year-old owner called the fire brigade , the block of flats where he lived had to be evacuated and the street cordoned off .
the doors and windows of the apartment had to be sealed and the whole place was gutted .
" we had to do everything in our power to find this cobra , " volker wiebels , a spokesperson for the city council said .
after three weeks of daily , painstaking searches in every nook and cranny , the reptile was finally found in the owner 's flat , on a sticky strip that had been laid out to catch the beast .
" it looked dried up , almost as if it was hollow inside , " a neighbor said after they found the snake .
owner must pay his share the city of muelheim will have to foot part of the bill , around 40,000 euros , as the incident is classed as a public hazard .
the rest should fall onto the owner , but he is unlikely to be able to pay , as he is currently unemployed .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoegstroem -lrb- right -rrb- denies the charges against him five other men have also been arrested in connection with the auschwitz theft , and three have been tried and sentenced to terms of between 18 months to two and a half years .
two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

the high-profile visit highlighted the strong links between the two nations . south africa is germany 's strategic link to africa .
the cooperation between the two countries stretches across several areas – labor , social affairs , economy , culture , science and renewable energies .
the strong ties were reinforced this week during a visit to south africa by german foreign minister guido westerwelle and development aid minister dirk niebel .
the high-profile ministerial visit underlines the importance that the german cabinet places on this special relationship .
' strategic partnership ' for germany , south africa is both a developing country and an economic partner .
for south africa , the relationship with germany is hugely important – it 's the largest investor and the second largest trading partner in the country .
the two nations support each other on the international stage on issues such as the expansion of the un security council or peacekeeping operations in africa .
" we have a strategic partnership with south africa which we want to further intensify , " foreign minister westerwelle said .
" the bilateral relations between our countries are excellent , but also coordination and cooperation in the global context . "
the two sides reviewed governmental development aid initiatives at a meeting in johannesburg .
the german government announced it will support the emerging economy in south africa with 112 million euros -lrb- $ 151 million -rrb- over the next two years .

" that would ensure south africa gets a better energy supply and allow the country to grow economically and better fight poverty , " niebel said .

" it also aims for sophisticated technologies in south africa that could be for example acquired in germany , " he said .
germany also said it plans to support south africa 's health sector .
niebel said the two nations had negotiated common goals in the fight against hiv / aids .
" as we know from other countries in africa , many governments deal with this issue very carefully .
i consider it a strong signal from the south african government that they are developing ownership of this topic , " niebel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.04.2010 sudan faces uncertain future as it goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was hoped the polls would give sudan new democratic legitimacy the credibility of sunday 's elections in sudan has been greatly weakened after several main opposition parties decided to boycott the polls .
eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if the poll is not fair , it looks set to go ahead nonetheless the united states has called on al-bashir to briefly delay the elections until more stability can be ensured .
after a closed-door briefing by the un peacekeeping chief , susan rice , us ambassador to the un , told reporters that " much is awry " with the election process in sudan .
she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .
observers believe that the international community 's real priority is next january 's referendum on possible independence for the south .
with the chance of secession on the horizon , this could also explain , in part , the splm 's willingness to restrict its electoral involvement even if it means letting al-bashir win for now .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .

priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoegstroem -lrb- right -rrb- denies the charges against him five other men have also been arrested in connection with the auschwitz theft , and three have been tried and sentenced to terms of between 18 months to two and a half years .
two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kaczynski was frequently vilified by those on the left of the political spectrum for his policies , which included banning a gay pride parade when he was mayor of warsaw .

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .
three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .
after the 19-year-old owner called the fire brigade , the block of flats where he lived had to be evacuated and the street cordoned off .
the doors and windows of the apartment had to be sealed and the whole place was gutted .
" we had to do everything in our power to find this cobra , " volker wiebels , a spokesperson for the city council said .
after three weeks of daily , painstaking searches in every nook and cranny , the reptile was finally found in the owner 's flat , on a sticky strip that had been laid out to catch the beast .
" it looked dried up , almost as if it was hollow inside , " a neighbor said after they found the snake .
owner must pay his share the city of muelheim will have to foot part of the bill , around 40,000 euros , as the incident is classed as a public hazard .
the rest should fall onto the owner , but he is unlikely to be able to pay , as he is currently unemployed .
" the snake may have been cheap , but unfortunately what happened next was n't , " wiebels said. ng / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .

priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has denied that there was a cover-up according to a 1981 letter from the diocese of oakland , the priest rev. stephen kiesle had himself asked to leave the ministry .
the diocese had asked ratzinger to agree that he be " relieved of all the obligations of the priesthood , including celibacy . "
arguments for and against at the time of the letter , ratzinger was responsible for enforcing roman catholic doctrine .
following years of correspondence about the proposed defrocking , the future pope said in the 1985 letter that arguments for the priest to be removed were of " grave significance . "
but , he added that he was also worried about what granting the request to remove the priest could " provoke with the community of christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .

mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "

an investigation is underway . poland 's president lech kaczynski and many of the country 's political elite were among the 97 people killed saturday when their plane crashed outside the city of smolensk , in western russia .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .

the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.04.2010 sudan faces uncertain future as it goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was hoped the polls would give sudan new democratic legitimacy the credibility of sunday 's elections in sudan has been greatly weakened after several main opposition parties decided to boycott the polls .
eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if the poll is not fair , it looks set to go ahead nonetheless the united states has called on al-bashir to briefly delay the elections until more stability can be ensured .
after a closed-door briefing by the un peacekeeping chief , susan rice , us ambassador to the un , told reporters that " much is awry " with the election process in sudan .
she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .
observers believe that the international community 's real priority is next january 's referendum on possible independence for the south .
with the chance of secession on the horizon , this could also explain , in part , the splm 's willingness to restrict its electoral involvement even if it means letting al-bashir win for now .

smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .
three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .
after the 19-year-old owner called the fire brigade , the block of flats where he lived had to be evacuated and the street cordoned off .
the doors and windows of the apartment had to be sealed and the whole place was gutted .
" we had to do everything in our power to find this cobra , " volker wiebels , a spokesperson for the city council said .
after three weeks of daily , painstaking searches in every nook and cranny , the reptile was finally found in the owner 's flat , on a sticky strip that had been laid out to catch the beast .
" it looked dried up , almost as if it was hollow inside , " a neighbor said after they found the snake .
owner must pay his share the city of muelheim will have to foot part of the bill , around 40,000 euros , as the incident is classed as a public hazard .
the rest should fall onto the owner , but he is unlikely to be able to pay , as he is currently unemployed .
" the snake may have been cheap , but unfortunately what happened next was n't , " wiebels said. ng / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .
three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .
after the 19-year-old owner called the fire brigade , the block of flats where he lived had to be evacuated and the street cordoned off .
the doors and windows of the apartment had to be sealed and the whole place was gutted .
" we had to do everything in our power to find this cobra , " volker wiebels , a spokesperson for the city council said .
after three weeks of daily , painstaking searches in every nook and cranny , the reptile was finally found in the owner 's flat , on a sticky strip that had been laid out to catch the beast .
" it looked dried up , almost as if it was hollow inside , " a neighbor said after they found the snake .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoegstroem -lrb- right -rrb- denies the charges against him five other men have also been arrested in connection with the auschwitz theft , and three have been tried and sentenced to terms of between 18 months to two and a half years .
two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has denied that there was a cover-up according to a 1981 letter from the diocese of oakland , the priest rev. stephen kiesle had himself asked to leave the ministry .
the diocese had asked ratzinger to agree that he be " relieved of all the obligations of the priesthood , including celibacy . "
arguments for and against at the time of the letter , ratzinger was responsible for enforcing roman catholic doctrine .
following years of correspondence about the proposed defrocking , the future pope said in the 1985 letter that arguments for the priest to be removed were of " grave significance . "
but , he added that he was also worried about what granting the request to remove the priest could " provoke with the community of christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

television images showed the burning fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest . " the polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing .
tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart , " said sergei antufyev , regional governor of smolensk , on state news channel rossiya-24 .
" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .
black box recovered one of the plane 's flight recorders has been found , and investigations into the crash of the russian-built tupolev tu-154 are underway .
polish justice minister krzysztof kwiatkowski said he would order a special inquiry into the crash , while russian president dmitry medvedev has set up a special commission to investigate the crash , to be headed by prime minister vladimir putin .
the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .

he was to visit katyn , near smolensk , to commemorate both russian and polish victims . initial reports suggested that as many as 132 people had been on board , but that number has since been revised to 96 .
passengers included kaczynski 's wife maria , leading historians and several of poland 's high-ranking officials , among them the chief of poland 's military franciszek gagor , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer and central bank governor slawomir skrzypek .
bildunterschrift : kaczynski was in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre " we still can not fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future .
nothing like this has ever happened in poland , " said piotr paszkowski , spokesman for poland 's foreign ministry .
polish prime minister donald tusk called the crash poland 's " most tragic event in post-war history . "
tusk will travel to the crash site where he will meet prime minister putin .
the speaker of the lower house of parliament , bronislaw komorowski , has been named acting president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 10.04.2010 kaczynski : a ' combative ' patriot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski was elected president in 2005 polish president lech kaczynski was a " combative european " and a patriot .
saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .

he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 10.04.2010 china faces mounting water shortages and desert expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women carry hay through the growing desert in china 's minqin county german environment minister norbert roettgen is striving to work with china on ecological and climate issues .
he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.04.2010 sudan faces uncertain future as it goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was hoped the polls would give sudan new democratic legitimacy the credibility of sunday 's elections in sudan has been greatly weakened after several main opposition parties decided to boycott the polls .
eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if the poll is not fair , it looks set to go ahead nonetheless the united states has called on al-bashir to briefly delay the elections until more stability can be ensured .
after a closed-door briefing by the un peacekeeping chief , susan rice , us ambassador to the un , told reporters that " much is awry " with the election process in sudan .
she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .
observers believe that the international community 's real priority is next january 's referendum on possible independence for the south .
with the chance of secession on the horizon , this could also explain , in part , the splm 's willingness to restrict its electoral involvement even if it means letting al-bashir win for now .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .
three weeks ago , a monocled cobra , which is only as long as a ruler and as thin as a pencil , but whose poison can kill within a few hours , escaped from its tank .
after the 19-year-old owner called the fire brigade , the block of flats where he lived had to be evacuated and the street cordoned off .
the doors and windows of the apartment had to be sealed and the whole place was gutted .
" we had to do everything in our power to find this cobra , " volker wiebels , a spokesperson for the city council said .
after three weeks of daily , painstaking searches in every nook and cranny , the reptile was finally found in the owner 's flat , on a sticky strip that had been laid out to catch the beast .

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoegstroem -lrb- right -rrb- denies the charges against him five other men have also been arrested in connection with the auschwitz theft , and three have been tried and sentenced to terms of between 18 months to two and a half years .
two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has denied that there was a cover-up according to a 1981 letter from the diocese of oakland , the priest rev. stephen kiesle had himself asked to leave the ministry .
the diocese had asked ratzinger to agree that he be " relieved of all the obligations of the priesthood , including celibacy . "
arguments for and against at the time of the letter , ratzinger was responsible for enforcing roman catholic doctrine .
following years of correspondence about the proposed defrocking , the future pope said in the 1985 letter that arguments for the priest to be removed were of " grave significance . "
but , he added that he was also worried about what granting the request to remove the priest could " provoke with the community of christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

russian officials said the plane hit trees as it came down in thick fog on its approach to the airport , about 275 miles -lrb- 440 kilometers -rrb- southwest of moscow .
television images showed the burning fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest . " the polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing .
tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart , " said sergei antufyev , regional governor of smolensk , on state news channel rossiya-24 .
" nobody has survived the disaster . " according to a spokesman from the polish foreign ministry in warsaw , the plane caught fire after the crash as rescue teams tried to pull passengers from the wreckage .
black box recovered one of the plane 's flight recorders has been found , and investigations into the crash of the russian-built tupolev tu-154 are underway .
polish justice minister krzysztof kwiatkowski said he would order a special inquiry into the crash , while russian president dmitry medvedev has set up a special commission to investigate the crash , to be headed by prime minister vladimir putin .
the plane was one of two such jets in the polish government fleet .
both were about 20 years old , though the downed jet had reportedly been fully repaired and refurbished in december , according to the plane 's manufacturer .
sergei razygrayev of the russian air force told the itar-tass news agency that the pilot had made four attempts to land in bad visibility and had refused an offer to land at another airport .
" the pilot was advised to fly to moscow or minsk because of heavy fog , but he still decided to land .
no one should have been landing in that fog , " a russian mission control official told reuters on condition of anonymity .
major delegation kaczynski was traveling to russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre , the murder of thousands of prisoners of war under soviet leader josef stalin during world war ii .
he was to visit katyn , near smolensk , to commemorate both russian and polish victims . initial reports suggested that as many as 132 people had been on board , but that number has since been revised to 96 .
passengers included kaczynski 's wife maria , leading historians and several of poland 's high-ranking officials , among them the chief of poland 's military franciszek gagor , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer and central bank governor slawomir skrzypek .
bildunterschrift : kaczynski was in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the katyn massacre " we still can not fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future .
nothing like this has ever happened in poland , " said piotr paszkowski , spokesman for poland 's foreign ministry .
polish prime minister donald tusk called the crash poland 's " most tragic event in post-war history . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 10.04.2010 kaczynski : a ' combative ' patriot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski was elected president in 2005 polish president lech kaczynski was a " combative european " and a patriot .
saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has denied that there was a cover-up according to a 1981 letter from the diocese of oakland , the priest rev. stephen kiesle had himself asked to leave the ministry .
the diocese had asked ratzinger to agree that he be " relieved of all the obligations of the priesthood , including celibacy . "
arguments for and against at the time of the letter , ratzinger was responsible for enforcing roman catholic doctrine .
following years of correspondence about the proposed defrocking , the future pope said in the 1985 letter that arguments for the priest to be removed were of " grave significance . "
but , he added that he was also worried about what granting the request to remove the priest could " provoke with the community of christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .

he concluded his trip today among growing concerns about desertification and drought in china . germany 's environment minister norbert roettgen concluded on friday three days of talks between german and chinese experts on how the countries can cooperate to address climate issues .
" as especially innovative nations , " roettgen said , " china and germany are called upon to lead the way toward the worldwide development of a greener economy . "
but china has far to go before it achieves anything resembling a green economy .
as the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gasses , china 's rapid economic and industrial development has contributed to major environmental problems domestically .
water shortages and accelerating desertification are just a few of the challenges facing the populous nation .
china 's southern region , for instance , is currently suffering its most severe drought in centuries , while the effects of sandstorms originating in the north are felt as far away as hong kong , located thousands of kilometers to the south .
quickly destroyed , slowly rebuilt minqin county in the northwestern province of gansu is particularly endangered by a desert growing quickly next door .
" some villages at the border to the desert had to be evacuated due to the wells drying up , while some houses have been buried completely in sand , " said sun qingwei of the academy of sciences in gansu 's capital , lanzhou .
" there 's much talk , but nothing is getting done .
a lot of places are in danger - this is really a basic political issue . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen hopes for more ecological cooperation with china problems with desert expansion are n't limited to the gansu province , though .
in the east , the desert is creeping closer and closer to beijing .
there , officials like wang jianfeng of the hunshandake desert control station have condemned the role major businesses play in destroying the environment and enabling desert regions to grow .
" there are areas where firms are generating their profits by hurting the environment , " wang said .
" the environment can be destroyed within a year but needs at least 100 years to regenerate itself . "
a " temporary " solution the chinese government is attempting to address problems relating to the desert and related water shortages by drawing upon a fifty-eight-year-old idea put forward by mao zedong .
the government has begun a massive building project that would funnel water from less arid areas to afflicted regions .
in some cases , the water would be transported thousands of kilometers .
for years , geographer bernd wuennemann has worked on a desert research project in china sponsored by the german academic exchange service .
he is skeptical of the chinese government 's proposal .
" in light of the long distances the water will have to travel , evaporation will become a significant factor .
the project may work as a temporary measure to address the needs of a region , but in so doing , it may ultimately create shortages elsewhere , " wuennemann said .

saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 10.04.2010 kaczynski : a ' combative ' patriot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski was elected president in 2005 polish president lech kaczynski was a " combative european " and a patriot .
saturday ’ s disaster in smolensk brought his life to an unexpected and tragic end . german chancellor angela merkel remembered lech kaczynski on saturday as a " combative european , " an accurate description of the late polish president .
politically conservative , a catholic nationalist and a euroskeptic , kaczynski was seen both in poland and abroad as a difficult negotiator and dialogue partner .
the strategy of his to hold out on signing the eu 's lisbon treaty and only sign it at the last minute was just one example of many .
his combativeness , a trait he shared with his twin brother jaroslaw , became one of his political trademarks .
in the eyes of his supporters , this combativeness was n't a disadvantage .
it was his fight for polish interests that made kaczynski a figurehead of the national conservative camp in poland .
born in warsaw in 1949 , he embodied the patriotic tradition of his country .
his parents fought in the warsaw uprising , taking part in that failed attempt to secure poland 's independence from its powerful neighbors in the last days of world war ii .
the tragic fate of poland and the resulting mistrust of germany and russia became an integral part of kaczynski 's upbringing and influenced his entire political life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and his twin brother jaroslaw were close political allies when the solidarity trade union was established in 1980 , kaczynski , then an established law professor , was among the advisers to the legendary union leader lech walesa .
walesa was elected president in 1991 , and nominated kaczynski as minister in the presidential chancellery .
the two men parted ways six months later following a conflict , and the tight political partnership gave way to bitter animosity .
' the man with the clean hands ' since the early 1990s , kaczynski had styled himself as " the man with the clean hands , " first as president of the supreme chamber of control , then as minister of justice and finally as the corruption-fighting mayor of warsaw .
voters , tired of the corruption scandals of the post-communist power elite , carried him into the country 's highest office in 2005 .
this fall , the president was planning to fight for his reelection .
his death in the smolensk disaster bears the characteristics of his entire political life .
on the one hand , there is a deep patriotism : kaczynski was on his way to russia to remember the massacre of polish soldiers in katyn during world war ii .
on the other hand , a deep rivalry : the visit to katyn was to have upstaged the earlier visit of prime minister donald tusk , his main political rival .
the death of lech kaczynski was unexpected and tragic – but could also lead to the creation of a legend .

the creature was eventually found dead in the owner 's apartment . it only cost the owner 70 euros initially , but a three-week operation involving the fire brigade , scores of builders and removal specialists to retrieve a small , poisonous cobra from a flat in the city of muelheim , racked up a bill of 100,000 euros , before the creature was found dead in the owner 's flat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 10.04.2010 mobile giants likely to dominate german wireless auction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile may get an unfair advantage in wireless broadband internet germany is auctioning off frequencies for high-speed wireless data transfer .
a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

a similar auction was held in 2000 , but this time only four leading wireless companies may bid .
smaller companies have cried foul . the airwave frequencies which will be auctioned starting monday in germany give mobile digital providers an opportunity to wirelessly send data further than ever before at rates up to 100 times faster than with a conventional dsl internet connection .
but the gold-rush mentality which was evident when frequencies for wireless data transfer were first auctioned in 2000 is unlikely to emerge .
instead , several companies are crying foul and saying mobile giants t-mobile and vodafone are poised to corner the market on high speed mobile data for years to come .
only four companies are being allowed to participate in the auction , which is expected to last several weeks : t-mobile , vodafone , e-plus and o2 telefonica .
in the 2000 auction , the german government netted the equivalent of some 50 billion euros ; this time experts are expecting proceeds closer to 6 billion euros .
court complaints dismissed stuttgart-based airdata provides wireless high-speed internet access and had hoped to expand its access to frequencies .
however , the company is being blocked from the auction , which is being held because demand for the limited number of frequencies surpasses those available .
a complaint the company filed in an administrative court in cologne was dismissed march 19 , along with ones from e-plus and o2 .
airdata spokesman thomas katz said the sheer buying power of t-mobile and vodafone put them in a position to dominate the rapidly expanding market for high-speed wireless internet .
" it has nothing to do with competition anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" if we do n't have any bidding rights the market leaders will simply buy up all of the frequencies on account of their market strength . "
according to katz , other european countries such as france entitle newcomers to the market to 20 megahertz , the minimum needed to set up a functional business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband internet is missing in spots across the german countryside at a later stage , mobile providers can focus on acquiring both low and high frequencies in order to stagger them .
low frequencies cover large distances and may reach into rural areas while high frequencies provide more capacity in urban areas .
" the simple fact is it 's necessary to have basic provisions in order to enter the market .
the point is simple : the conditions of this procedure clearly disadvantage some competitors , " he said .
rural areas to get wireless frequencies below one gigahertz are central to the debate .
they became available in recent years when germany digitalized its television and radio signals and are suitable for bringing high-speed internet to rural areas .
the german government hopes to eliminate " white spots " lacking broadband coverage and wants all homes to at least have a 1-megabit internet connection by the end of 2010 .
wireless broadband test markets exist in oslo , stockholm and innsbruck , and the hardware necessary to access them is already commercially available .
industry trade confederation bitkom predicted the technology will become affordable to the average consumer by the end of this year , when it will begin to grow in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal regulator matthias kurth says demand surpasses supply still , those disadvantaged by monday 's auction say germany 's federal network agency should foster a more competitive marketplace for the good of companies and consumers alike .
e-plus spokesman guido heitmann said while his company will participate in the auction , they do not believe the " allocation is taking place in a manner which entirely conforms to free market competition . "
" we are participating to get appropriate frequencies at an appropriate price in order to facilitate the further development of a cost-effective and powerful network , " he told deutsche welle .
" the demand for data transfer is growing and we need to see to it that we capitalize on that . "

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .
polish justice officials indicted hoegstroem in january for suspected involvement in the december theft of the infamous auschwitz sign , which translates to " work will set you free . "
authorities issued a warrant for hoegstroem 's arrest on february 2 , and swedish police arrested him nine days later .

two of the five have said hoegstroem asked them to steal the sign .
mastermind or middle-man ?
hoegstroem founded the swedish neo-nazi national socialist front in 1994 , and led it for five years before quitting .
he has denied the charges against him , and claimed to swedish media that his role in the theft was to act as a middle-man , passing the sign from the thieves to a buyer .
he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

krakow prosecutors hope to begin the hearing on monday .
hoegstroem 's attorney bjoern sandin has said his client could receive up to 10 years in prison for charges of stealing , destroying and selling a cultural object of importance .

he also claimed to have informed polish police about who was behind the theft .
authorities recovered the sign cut in three pieces , and returned it to the auschwitz museum on january 21 , less than a week before ceremonies marked the 65th anniversary of soviet troops ' liberation of the camp. acb / epf / afp editor : catherine bolsover send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cooperation between the two countries stretches across several areas – labor , social affairs , economy , culture , science and renewable energies .
the strong ties were reinforced this week during a visit to south africa by german foreign minister guido westerwelle and development aid minister dirk niebel .
the high-profile ministerial visit underlines the importance that the german cabinet places on this special relationship .
' strategic partnership ' for germany , south africa is both a developing country and an economic partner .
for south africa , the relationship with germany is hugely important – it 's the largest investor and the second largest trading partner in the country .
the two nations support each other on the international stage on issues such as the expansion of the un security council or peacekeeping operations in africa .
" we have a strategic partnership with south africa which we want to further intensify , " foreign minister westerwelle said .
" the bilateral relations between our countries are excellent , but also coordination and cooperation in the global context . "
the two sides reviewed governmental development aid initiatives at a meeting in johannesburg .
the german government announced it will support the emerging economy in south africa with 112 million euros -lrb- $ 151 million -rrb- over the next two years .

niebel announced a special budget of 75 million euros to focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency in south africa .
" that would ensure south africa gets a better energy supply and allow the country to grow economically and better fight poverty , " niebel said .
the minister did n't shy away from mentioning germany 's economic interest in bolstering south africa 's energy sector .
" it also aims for sophisticated technologies in south africa that could be for example acquired in germany , " he said .
germany also said it plans to support south africa 's health sector .
niebel said the two nations had negotiated common goals in the fight against hiv / aids .
" as we know from other countries in africa , many governments deal with this issue very carefully .
i consider it a strong signal from the south african government that they are developing ownership of this topic , " niebel said .

" the situation there has remained unchanged .
we 're monitoring it with great concern , " westerwelle said .
but that was one of the only disagreements in a meeting marked by a show of cordiality and friendliness .
but the german development minister did point out that the two sides had failed to see eye to eye on a crucial issue at a time when south africa gears up to host the soccer world cup in june .
" we could not agree on who will win the world cup : germany or south africa , " niebel joked .

he highlighted concerns about the priest ’ s young age and how any dismissal would affect the church .
the letter , originally written in latin and translated for the agency , comes to light as the vatican fends off allegations that the pope mishandled abuse cases during his time as a bishop in germany and a vatican official before his election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has denied that there was a cover-up according to a 1981 letter from the diocese of oakland , the priest rev. stephen kiesle had himself asked to leave the ministry .
the diocese had asked ratzinger to agree that he be " relieved of all the obligations of the priesthood , including celibacy . "
arguments for and against at the time of the letter , ratzinger was responsible for enforcing roman catholic doctrine .
following years of correspondence about the proposed defrocking , the future pope said in the 1985 letter that arguments for the priest to be removed were of " grave significance . "
but , he added that he was also worried about what granting the request to remove the priest could " provoke with the community of christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
priest was sentenced according to the associated press , kiesle was 38 at the time and had been sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct for tying up and molesting two young boys in a church rectory .
asked about reports about the documents , the vatican 's deputy spokesman , the rev. ciro benedettini , said the then-cardinal ratzinger had not covered up the case but wanted it " studied with greater attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 10.04.2010 sudan faces uncertain future as it goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was hoped the polls would give sudan new democratic legitimacy the credibility of sunday 's elections in sudan has been greatly weakened after several main opposition parties decided to boycott the polls .
eu monitors have also left .
where will africa 's largest country go from here ? sudan 's elections have been billed as the first multi-party polls since 1986 .
but only minor opposition parties will be standing against president omar al-bashir and his party in the north .
this after the umma party 's pull-out and the announcement by the sudanese people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- - the main political force in southern sudan - that it would only contest the south . the boycott , which comes after allegations of vote rigging , means al-bashir , who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide , is almost certain to win the presidential poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umma has pulled out citing electoral irregularities .
along with al-bashir 's political opponents , international and local rights groups have also heavily criticized the electoral process .
the announcement earlier this week by eu election observers that they would not observe the vote in volatile dafur has dealt another blow .
an exercise in flawed democracy nonetheless , some sudanese believe it is important that the vote goes ahead nonetheless .
from sunday onwards , the population will have three days ' time to cast their ballot in parliamentary , presidential , regional and gubernatorial polls .
reverend ramadan chan liol , head of the sudan council of churches , described the elections as " historic . "
the national church leader has been preoccupied with the topic for months , as churches will be sending observers to polling offices and have been involved in awareness-raising campaigns in many parishes .
" well , at least it will give those people who have never voted an idea of how it is supposed to go .
it will demonstrate how democratic elections function - even if it will not be very democratic , " chan liol told deutsche welle .
first time voters most sudanese have never stood before a ballot box in their life or held a ballot paper in their hand .
these are the first elections in 24 years after a protracted and bloody civil war between rebels from the mainly christian south and government troops from the mainly muslim north . five years ago , a peace deal between khartoum and the southern rebels promised to end a generation of conflict that cost 1.5 million lives .
this weekend 's elections are a key part of that agreement .
but despite the deal , the situation in the south is far from calm where there has been an escalation of inter-ethnic clashes .
unrest in darfur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in darfur diverse rebel groups are still fighting the government and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur means that many people there are either unable or unwilling to take part in the electoral process .
safety fears have forced the eu to withdraw its election observers from the western region - just days before voting is due to start .
the fighting between diverse rebel groups , janjaweed militiamen and the sudanese army has displaced an estimated 2.7 million people and caused the deaths of another 300,000 .
" we are not in a situation in which the population of darfur can take part in these elections .
in addition many people in the refugee camps have refused to add their names to the electoral registers .
because for them that would be tantamount to accepting the refugee camp as their home .
they come from villages destroyed by the janjaweed militia and the sudanese army , " said jacky marmour , from the organization together for darfur .
in other cases , human rights groups say the authorities have deliberately omitted people from the electoral rolls because the government suspect that they are likely to vote for the opposition after years of conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of displaced people in darfur is an obstacle to the vote the international crisis group think tank said darfur had been so manipulated that the territory could swing the national vote and secure a win for bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- in the parliamentary elections .
" winning big in darfur is central to the ncp 's plan to capture enough votes in the north to ensure its continued national dominance , " an icg report said . apparent vote rigging of this kind is one of the reasons for the major opposition parties ' decision to boycott the poll .
the opposition also accuses the government in khartoum of arresting opposition supporters and detaining them without trial .
there have also been other difficulties , according to mou thiik , program manager for germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , " there have been some laws that have not been ratified or not withdrawn , the public order law , for example , which actually can interfere with the fair conduct of the election itself .
the press laws , the security laws there have not been rectified to the advantage of the public and the parties , and therefore the opposition parties are worried about how fair and free these elections are going to be , " said thiik . test run for january ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if the poll is not fair , it looks set to go ahead nonetheless the united states has called on al-bashir to briefly delay the elections until more stability can be ensured .
after a closed-door briefing by the un peacekeeping chief , susan rice , us ambassador to the un , told reporters that " much is awry " with the election process in sudan .
she described the trends on the ground as " very disturbing " .
observers believe that the international community 's real priority is next january 's referendum on possible independence for the south .
with the chance of secession on the horizon , this could also explain , in part , the splm 's willingness to restrict its electoral involvement even if it means letting al-bashir win for now .

william windsor , or billy for short , was picked from a herd living on the great orme in llandudno .
after his training at the regimental camp in chester , starred in a help the heroes event in llangollen on saturday .
he was also posing for photos with people attending a cabaret and auction at the wild waters hotel from 1830 bst .
organiser heather davies said one family had promised to attend so the children of a soldier serving in afghanistan could have their photo taken with billy .
the tradition of a regimental goat dates back to the american war of independence when a wild goat wandered onto a battlefield .
legend has it the goat ended up leading the regimental colours .
in 1884 queen victoria presented the regiment , then called the royal welch fusiliers , with a goat from her royal herd , and the tradition has continued .
the last regimental goat , william ' billy ' windsor , retired last year after a seven-year military career .
his replacement - not a mascot but a full member of the regiment - has been put through his paces by the " goat major , " a lance corporal who looks after him , at the chester barracks , ahead of the regiment 's return from afghanistan in may .
' heavy responsibilities ' the help for heroes event on saturday was one of billy 's first public appearances .
speaking before the event , commanding officer major brian blore said : " he should behave - hopefully !
he is quite good now .
he has been marching around the camp , seeing the soldiers and getting used to the public . "
billy , who is to lead the drums around during regimental parades , had behaved well during the st david 's day celebrations and officers ' dinner the night before , said maj blore .
help for heroes event organiser heather davies said : " this is a wonderful tradition going back many years and people will want to meet the new young goat who has had heavy responsibilities thrust upon him since he left the great orme . "
the goat is a member of the battalion and in previous days when the battalion was traditionally 1,000 men strong , it was always 999 plus the goat .
