in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as south korea conducts more live-fire military drills , north korea threatens to wage a ' sacred ' nuclear war . the normally busy streets of seoul came to a halt during recent air raid drills . the practice occurs every month , but after north korea 's deadly shelling of yeonpyeong island , the threat of war seems much more serious now for many koreans . the tension this year began with the sinking in march of the south korean navy vessel , the cheonan , which killed 46 sailors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some analysts say north korea has been especially provocative this year because of the ongoing power transition as a result , conservative south korean president lee myung bak took an even harder line on north korea 's kim jong-il regime , cutting off business ties and pushing for international condemnation at the un . clear motivation for shelling of yeonpyeong but just as relations seemed to be improving this fall , artillery fell on yeonpyeong island . andrei lankov , a north korea analyst at seoul ’ s kookmin university , thinks pyongyang ’ s motivations for launching these attacks were clear . " north korea is not receiving aid from south korea and the united states , and it makes them increasingly dependent on china .
they are not desperate but they are dependent on china and don ’ t want this , so they are trying to create tensions , " he explained . lankov added that if pyongyang , which is currently in the midst of a power transition , thought washington and seoul felt threatened enough , they would have no choice but to resume engagement and start handing out material support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean border guards near the border village of panmunjom in paju " need to engage in dialogue " chung dong young , a former south korean minister of unification and a lawmaker in the main opposition party , said that the attacks this year had only been made possible because of president lee ’ s stance on the north . " if we really want to prevent war , we need the courage to engage in dialogue . " he said .
" with a dialogue , there would be no sound of gunfire .
the yeonpyeong shelling broke out during an absence of dialogue and in a heightened state of tension .
for the stability of the korean peninsula , we should immediately resume talks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and south korea regularly hold military drills that north korea routinely criticizes but chung added that it was not only south korea 's responsibility to engage the north .
he said the us has also failed to recognize pyongyang ’ s overtures . earlier this week , north korea reportedly told a visiting us politician that it would allow inspections of its nuclear facilities , a move seen as a way to jumpstart the stalled six-party denuclearization talks . but for now , both washington and seoul seem reluctant to re-engage .
south korea has vowed it will not tolerate any further provocations from the north . lankov predicted that there would be more such provocations .
" maybe in late spring .
this time , maybe for the first time in decades , there are good reasons to be afraid , just slightly afraid , of a real korean war , because the public mood in south korea is extremely tense . " he thought that this tension could push seoul into striking back harder than ever before . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 23.12.2010 postcard from europe : east meets west in russia for christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year is the most popular holiday in russia in russia , christmas was only restored in the 1990s after the soviet union fell apart .
in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the everyday reality in afghanistan is very different .
some local ngos are determined to improve the lives of afghan women . almost 10 years after the us-led coalition invaded afghanistan , with promises of improving the lives of ordinary citizens and especially women who had suffered inordinately at the hands of the taliban , the human rights situation has not improved that much in the war-torn country . dr soraya sobrang has been trying to improve women 's rights as part of the work of afghanistan ’ s independent human rights commission . she says the taliban continue to violate human rights " not only in takhar but in kunduz too , where a woman and a man were recently stoned to death .
in the province of ghor there was an incident where a woman was publicly humiliated by a commander . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban continue to perpetrate violations against women women considered second-class however , misogyny is not limited to the taliban .
religious , cultural and family tradition shapes everyday life in much of afghanistan .
women are often considered second-class citizens .
if they are raped or abused , they are usually blamed . " there are many examples of women being killed by their families in the name of tradition , " says hamid safwat , the head of the cooperation center afghanistan in mazar-e-sharif . " if a woman is raped for example , the family often wants it to be kept secret at any cost .
some people kill their daughters so that they can not talk about it .
that ’ s why we opened this ' safe house , ' to support women , " he explains . although the " safe house " helps protect women and even provides them with legal advice , the perpetrators still go unpunished far too often . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young afghan women are at the mercy of their families , who sometimes marry them off against their will weda hamed from the association for justice says this has to change : " we want those who have committed a crime to be tried in court .
they need their weapons and their power to be removed .
criminals who have been committing crimes for three decades are often not judged .
the courts are corrupt and the sentences are inappropriate . " important not to send out wrong message sakina husain , who is a member of herat ’ s provincial council , says it is important to try the perpetrators and punish them so the wrong message is not sent out to the whole population of afghanistan . she says there is one group of women who need particular attention : " the wives of fundamentalists experience a lot of suffering .
we have to talk about their lives because they are the witnesses of the suffering that has also befallen us . " although human rights activists in afghanistan say there has been some improvement in the lives of women , there is still a long way to go .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

some wonder if the harsh winters are caused by climate change , while others ponder ways to deal with it . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .
we better get used to harsh winters ... climate change ! - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.12.2010 un human rights council condemns post-election violence in ivory coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un forces have had their peacekeeping mission in abidjan extended the un human rights council has passed a resolution denouncing abductions , sexual violence and extra-judicial killings in ivory coast .
this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .

in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .

but the everyday reality in afghanistan is very different .
some local ngos are determined to improve the lives of afghan women . almost 10 years after the us-led coalition invaded afghanistan , with promises of improving the lives of ordinary citizens and especially women who had suffered inordinately at the hands of the taliban , the human rights situation has not improved that much in the war-torn country . dr soraya sobrang has been trying to improve women 's rights as part of the work of afghanistan ’ s independent human rights commission . she says the taliban continue to violate human rights " not only in takhar but in kunduz too , where a woman and a man were recently stoned to death .
in the province of ghor there was an incident where a woman was publicly humiliated by a commander . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban continue to perpetrate violations against women women considered second-class however , misogyny is not limited to the taliban .
religious , cultural and family tradition shapes everyday life in much of afghanistan .
women are often considered second-class citizens .
if they are raped or abused , they are usually blamed . " there are many examples of women being killed by their families in the name of tradition , " says hamid safwat , the head of the cooperation center afghanistan in mazar-e-sharif . " if a woman is raped for example , the family often wants it to be kept secret at any cost .
some people kill their daughters so that they can not talk about it .
that ’ s why we opened this ' safe house , ' to support women , " he explains . although the " safe house " helps protect women and even provides them with legal advice , the perpetrators still go unpunished far too often . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young afghan women are at the mercy of their families , who sometimes marry them off against their will weda hamed from the association for justice says this has to change : " we want those who have committed a crime to be tried in court .
they need their weapons and their power to be removed .
criminals who have been committing crimes for three decades are often not judged .
the courts are corrupt and the sentences are inappropriate . " important not to send out wrong message sakina husain , who is a member of herat ’ s provincial council , says it is important to try the perpetrators and punish them so the wrong message is not sent out to the whole population of afghanistan . she says there is one group of women who need particular attention : " the wives of fundamentalists experience a lot of suffering .
we have to talk about their lives because they are the witnesses of the suffering that has also befallen us . " although human rights activists in afghanistan say there has been some improvement in the lives of women , there is still a long way to go .
moreover , they warn that the small political improvements there have been are extremely volatile and could easily be overturned . author : ute hempelmann and homeira heidary -lrb- act -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the everyday reality in afghanistan is very different .
some local ngos are determined to improve the lives of afghan women . almost 10 years after the us-led coalition invaded afghanistan , with promises of improving the lives of ordinary citizens and especially women who had suffered inordinately at the hands of the taliban , the human rights situation has not improved that much in the war-torn country . dr soraya sobrang has been trying to improve women 's rights as part of the work of afghanistan ’ s independent human rights commission . she says the taliban continue to violate human rights " not only in takhar but in kunduz too , where a woman and a man were recently stoned to death .
in the province of ghor there was an incident where a woman was publicly humiliated by a commander . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban continue to perpetrate violations against women women considered second-class however , misogyny is not limited to the taliban .
religious , cultural and family tradition shapes everyday life in much of afghanistan .
women are often considered second-class citizens .
if they are raped or abused , they are usually blamed . " there are many examples of women being killed by their families in the name of tradition , " says hamid safwat , the head of the cooperation center afghanistan in mazar-e-sharif . " if a woman is raped for example , the family often wants it to be kept secret at any cost .
some people kill their daughters so that they can not talk about it .
that ’ s why we opened this ' safe house , ' to support women , " he explains . although the " safe house " helps protect women and even provides them with legal advice , the perpetrators still go unpunished far too often . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young afghan women are at the mercy of their families , who sometimes marry them off against their will weda hamed from the association for justice says this has to change : " we want those who have committed a crime to be tried in court .
they need their weapons and their power to be removed .
criminals who have been committing crimes for three decades are often not judged .
the courts are corrupt and the sentences are inappropriate . " important not to send out wrong message sakina husain , who is a member of herat ’ s provincial council , says it is important to try the perpetrators and punish them so the wrong message is not sent out to the whole population of afghanistan . she says there is one group of women who need particular attention : " the wives of fundamentalists experience a lot of suffering .
we have to talk about their lives because they are the witnesses of the suffering that has also befallen us . " although human rights activists in afghanistan say there has been some improvement in the lives of women , there is still a long way to go .
moreover , they warn that the small political improvements there have been are extremely volatile and could easily be overturned . author : ute hempelmann and homeira heidary -lrb- act -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 23.12.2010 crossing continents : european art festival looks to north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's modern art museum exhibits artists from all over the world the famed alhambra palace is just one of the treasures the moors left as their legacy in spain .
that heritage is often lost in modern-day spain , but the manifesta festival is putting it back on the agenda . caught between two civilizations , southern spain has been fought over in the name of both christianity and islam .
today , it is seen as a bridge between north africa and europe , between two continents and two cultures .
it forms the perfect location for the eighth edition of manifesta , the roving european art festival , during which art exhibits , films , sculpture and performance work exploring the region 's identity are scattered between the town of murcia and the coastal city of cartagena .
more than 150 artists from around the world are taking part in the festival , which continues until january 9 , focusing their art on the historic relationship of conflict and coexistence between spain and north africa . murcia , the so-called orchard of europe , lies closer to algeria than madrid , spain 's capital .
founded by the moors in the 9th century , madinat mursiya flourished over the centuries and following the spanish reconquista became part of castile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many photographers and video artists participate in this year 's manifesta 8 dialogue instead of division in cartagena 's 18th-century former navy hospital , laurent grasso 's film tells of the city 's role as a surveillance port looking out towards north africa .
the paris-based artist switches between the past and the present as he draws out the fears and suspicions that consume both the city 's history and its present-day reality .
hedwig fijen , founding director of manifesta , said murcia had been chosen for this year 's location because of the growing cultural tensions across europe .
" the political situation in europe is changing .
i think we have forgotten a time in european history when there was coexistence , when there was no islamophobia , " she said .
" artists can investigate how these political problems have an effect on the daily lives of people .
through the eyes of the artists , we see a different perception . " a new way of looking at terrorism american artist michael takeo magruder 's controversial work focuses on the heart of the modern conflict .
his multimedia installation in cartegena 's modern art museum uses sound and pictures from the madrid train bombings in 2004 .
speaking about his work , magruder said that he wanted to create an alternative dialogue about terrorism away from the mainstream media .
" in our society , politicians use terrorist attacks for their own political purposes to sway the country , to get re-elected , to consolidate their power , " he said .
" the media often uses these attacks unethically . they create a tragic spectacle to boost ratings .
as artists we can provide an alternative space . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former artillery barracks in murcia exhibits artwork in a historic setting .
crossing cultures through art bouchra ouizguen , an artist from morocco , came to murcia to perform her work using dance and music to look at the role of women in islam , exploring the themes of friendship , isolation and pain .
the performance called " madame plaza " looks at the lives of four moroccan women interacting and exploring their own identities .
throughout the performance the wails of " aïta , " music inspired by moroccan folklore , echo around the stage in murcia 's former artillery barracks . from dance to cinema to sculpture and painting , manifesta is open to all kinds of artists and welcomes all visitors .
from the contemporary to the traditional , the festival seeks to include all forms of expression true to its founding mantra of co-existence and understanding .
the bi-annual festival was founded in the early 1990s in amsterdam after the fall of the berlin wall , the festival originally sought to forge artistic links between eastern and western europe .
this year , it is crossing over to north africa .
the organizers say they hope to use art where politics has failed and bring two cultures with a shared history in southern spain closer together .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 23.12.2010 ' the president just would n't accept no for an answer ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas e. mann only days ago the signs were ominous that the us senate would reject the start arms reduction treaty , but as thomas e. mann tells dw , president barack obama stuck to his guns and has come away with an important victory . thomas e. mann is the w. averell harimann chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution .
he 's also a member of the council on foreign relations .
deutsche welle : the start treaty was passed with a majority of 71 votes - were you surprised ?
thomas mann : no , the last couple of days have seen a movement among republicans to support ratification of the treaty and it seemed likely that they would get at least 70 and possibly higher .
it was n't the kind of near unanimous vote that we 're used to having on arms control treaties .
but given the extraordinary effort by the no. 1 and 2 republican leaders in the senate against ratification i think it 's a significant achievement . for a long time it looked as if the obama administration would not get the majority of the votes .
what was the tipping point ?
the administration had been working for months with senator jon kyl who was sort of the policy leader on this front … it had been negotiating with him with the expectation that reasonable compromises addressing concerns such as freedom to move ahead on missile defense and modernizing our nuclear weapons … that the republicans would fall in line , but as we got closer to the end of the 111th congress it became increasingly apparent that kyl was going to do everything in his power to prevent any action from occurring and pushing it into the next congress where prospects would diminish given the nature of the new members coming and those leaving .
at that point the administration started working seriously working with other republicans who would more naturally respond to the strong support for its ratification among very prominent former republican national security officials .
contrary to what the republicans argue , the treaty was not rushed through .
no , there were a large number of hearings conducted , there were ample opportunities for additional debate and consideration .
my own view is that for most of the senators reluctant to play ball it was more a desire to deny the president a victory than it was serious concerns about the substance of the treaty .
so it was not about substance but about political wrangling ?
that is right .
they argued it on substance , but each of the issues raised were answered and with impressive arguments and evidence … there was n't in the end a serious substantive argument against it .
and that 's why some of the senators like john mccain and lindsey graham ended up looking petulant .
it was embarrassing that senator lindsey graham was complaining about the productivity of a lame duck session , that so many things were accomplished that president obama was not further wounded but was strengthened .
have you ever seen this kind of wrangling during the last days of a congress before ?
yes i have - the ending of a legislative session is oftentimes a mess especially in the senate .
it 's a very partisan era of american politics , parties are deeply polarized , and engaged in partisan war to an extent we have n't seen over a century .
but was what is striking is how productive the 111th congress has been … the initial and the second stimulus , health care reform , financial regulation and a series of other domestic policy achievements , managing to get the defense authorization bill passed , the do n't ask do n't tell policy repealed and the new start treaty ratified is quite an achievement .
so for those who see nothing but dysfunction in our politics it 's important to realize that the combination and party polarization and senate filibusters makes it very difficult for a majority to achieve its objectives .
and certainly a number of items like climate change legislation and immigration were not achieved and nonetheless inspite of all of that and the perfectly dreadful way the process appears to the public , i think that the president and the democrats can be pleased that they have ended a very productive congress .
you mentioned president obama - how important is this ratification for him , after all , he invested a lot in supporting this treaty ?
i think it 's important .
this is one in which he really stuck to his guns .
he just would n't accept no for an answer .
he said it was critically important to american national security .
our standing in the world , our relations with russia , and our policies and efforts with iran and north korea , he really raised the stakes for himself in pushing ahead with this - it has to be a boost to him , certainly countries around the world will look upon this as a major achievement and feel a bit more comfortable working with the president .
is the start treaty more of a symbolic act ?
how important is it really for the us-russian relations and for nuclear proliferation ?
it 's not a dramatically ambitious agreement , but it needed to be passed , if only to maintain inspection regimes , it 's mainly to keep relations and negotiations with the russians alive and to maintain credibility in the world for trying to deal with problems of nuclear proliferation .
it 's not that the achievement itself was substantively historic , but it 's agreement and ratification are very important for the broader security agenda .
does this turn the year around for him ?
it certainly means that the setback from the midterm election which is real but is largely driven by the economic conditions in this country that that setback is in no way going to paralyze him for months or a full year .
he can take a punch , he 's absorbed the loss but he 's pushing ahead .
he 'll find congress much more difficult to work with with the republican majority in the house and a diminished democratic majority in the senate .
he 'll be playing defense as far as some of his achievements in the 111th congress -lsb- are concerned -rsb- .
he 'll almost certainly be turning to areas where he has the authority to act alone as the chief executive and head of the administrative process of government .
i think it 's also the case in getting some additional stimulus out of congress and we 'll likely see some economic growth and a decline of the unemployment rate over the next year or so as we lead up to the presidential election year and that will certainly strengthen his position going into reelection .

as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?

wolfsburg attempted a comeback in the second half , but were only able to manage a consolation goal through edin dzeko in the 56th minute , and the game ended 3-1 .
after eight games without a win , former england manager mcclaren 's future with the club is in doubt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.12.2010 bees bring sweet business for india 's farmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beekeeping helps farmers to improve their living conditions drought and low crop yields have led to poor living conditions for many indian farmers .
now an ngo is trying to increase farm income through beekeeping , while saving threatened local bee populations at the same time . monsoon is somar devji maghi 's favourite time of year .
an iridescent green has swept across the ground and for the next four months , somar will plant , turn soil and watch his farm grow .
the 26-year-old lives in dandwal , a small village in gujarat , in india 's south .
somar wishes he could spend his whole year here but he ca n't grow enough to support the family .
when monsoon ends he works on other people 's farms making just 60 rupees – or one euro – a day .
as india pushes forward with its quest for development , small farmers like somar are getting left behind , according to vijaya pastala .
" gujarat is the fastest growing state but there are still many tribal villages that do n't have electricity .
not many finish school , not many go to college , women are married early .
a lot of them are loan-dependent , money-lender-dependent . "
a sustainable solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many tribal villages without electricity vijaya pastala is the ceo of under the mango tree -lrb- utmt -rrb- , a company that links organic small farms to a national market .
after witnessing tribal life in gujarat , vijaya was determined to help .
in march 2009 she launched the not-for-profit bees for poverty reduction program .
farmers buy a starter kit of two bright blue bee boxes at 2,500 rupees or 42 euros .
they then undergo an intensive training program , where they learn how to find , capture , box and care for the indigenous bee – apis cerena .
beekeeping in india is not like beekeeping in the west .
there is no protective suit , it 's just your bare skin up against thousands of potentially angry bees .
it takes patience , persistence and courage . " i 've been stung up to 100 times in a single day when boxing hives , " utmt 's bee expert atar singh said .
however , as jhula mahado found out , the pain pays off when you hit pay dirt for the first time .
for months , jhula has been carefully tending his hive .
every two days he checks the combs making sure that they are sheltered from the wind and rain .
each day he watched as swarms of black and gold entered the box carrying packs of pollen .
as atar opens the box to show , more than 45 thousands bees swarm around rich yellow combs , oozing with honey .
the combs are cut and the honey extracted .
jhula will make 16 euros from this batch .
he should be able to collect honey every 15 to 20 days for the next four months .
it 's a huge boost to his average annual income , which is less than 170 euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh honey makes up for numerous painful bee stings more than just honey according to atar , the rewards of beekeeping go even further .
" honey is just a by product or direct advantage to the beekeepers .
the indirect advantages are much more , even in terms of monetary benefits .
having bees helps to increase their agricultural productivity through pollination .
bees are responsible for 80 percent pollination for the crop , which increases about 35 to 40 percent of yield , " he explained .
more importantly , atar said , beekeeping is helping his favourite bee , apis cerena , make a long- needed comeback .
the cerena is an indigenous indian bee – famous for its small size and ability to crawl into delicate flowers .
but their population is dwindling due to loss of habitat and disease .
one of the worst health scares , atar explained , started in 1972 with the introduction of apis mellifera – a european bee .
" apis mellifera could actually produce 75 to 85 kilos of honey versus apis cerena which could only produce 5 to 7 kilos of honey .
but within six months a viral disease known as sad brood had been introduced and it caused a lot of harm to the indigenous bee population . "
the other threat has been india 's tradition of honey hunting .
searching for gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the population of india 's indigenous bee is dwindling somu sotru is a traditional honey hunter .
he goes into the forest , finds a hive , smokes it until the bees leave and then crushes it to get the honey .
" we go into the forest with an axe and cut the honey comb .
we squeeze the honey and throw the combs away .
we collect it into plastic bags and then sell it , " somu said .
somu has two bee boxes on his farm , but when atar opens them , the hives are empty and covered in white webs , created by wax moths .
somu lacks the patience required to care for bees , and still views honey hunting as a quick fix .
although some older farmers like somu remain unconvinced of the benefits of beekeeping , others like somar devji maghi have embraced the opportunity .
the program has trained 600 farmers , out of which 100 are master trainers like somar .
they help farmers catch , keep and care for the bees .
" now it 's just seven people who have taken up this activity .
i want more people to take up this activity , as well as the landless .
i want the activities to be so good that you take the name of our village everywhere you go , " somar said .
somar has already noticed an increase of productivity this year .
he has collected cucumbers every three days , compared to every six and hopes to have eight to ten bee boxes on his farm by the end of next year .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .
the ministry 's leadership has apparently not seen or approved the document , and it does not represent the ministry 's position .
" this is not the path we 're following , " the statement said .
permanent financial security in addition to germany , finland , france , ireland and the netherlands are working on various proposals .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is to discuss the plans with his french counterpart lagarde on thursday in strasbourg , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german finance ministry said the documents quoted do not represent its position the newspaper quoted lagarde in a separate article as saying : " we will discuss how we can work more closely together . "
the eu set up a 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- rescue fund with the help of the international monetary fund in the fallout from the greek debt crisis , but it runs for only three years .
at an eu summit earlier this month , leaders agreed to replace the emergency fund with a permanent mechanism from mid-2013 but the precise details are yet to be agreed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.12.2010 un human rights council condemns post-election violence in ivory coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un forces have had their peacekeeping mission in abidjan extended the un human rights council has passed a resolution denouncing abductions , sexual violence and extra-judicial killings in ivory coast .
this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .

hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .

" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

but a couple of obstacles still have to be cleared before it can come into force . russian leaders on thursday welcomed the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- by the united states senate , with top lawmakers saying the ratification process could start before the end of the week .
the news agency interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying the new start " will not only further russian and us security , but it will have a positive effect on international security and stability . "
a spokeswoman for president dmitry medvedev said he welcomed the ratification " with satisfaction " and " expressed hope that the duma and federation council are ready to examine this question and ratify the document . "
under the accord , russia and the united states pledge to cut their stockpile of active nuclear warheads to 1,550 within seven years , or about 30 percent from when the first start , signed in 1991 , expired a year ago .
both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the duma may approve the new start this week medvedev and us president barack obama signed the new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .
russian ratification near the us senate on wednesday voted 71-26 to ratify the treaty , giving obama a major foreign policy victory before the current senate adjourns and his democrats lose several seats to newly-elected republicans in january .
democratic leaders in the senate allowed some non-binding amendments to the original document to secure more republican support .
these included a recommitment to deploying a missile defense system , modernization of the current nuclear arsenal and seeking new talks with russia on limiting tactical nuclear weapons .
while there is some opposition to the treaty among opposition parties in the duma , medvedev 's united russia party enjoys a strong majority and the body was widely expected to approve it .
but konstantin kosachev , chairman of the duma 's foreign affairs committee , said russian lawmakers would need to study and respond to the amendments made by their american counterparts before giving their final approval .
the treaty 's first reading and debate in the duma was scheduled for december 24 .
" further work on the ratification bill will continue once the duma resumes its work in january , " news agencies quoted kosachev as saying .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "

the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 23.12.2010 spanish builder acs plays divide and conquer at hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders say workers ' worst fears have been removed hochtief 's works council is angry that german builders ' union ig bau has dropped its opposition to a takeover bid from spanish company acs .
the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the announcement follows eu-sino talks earlier this week . china said on thursday it was willing to support eurozone countries through the region 's debt crisis .
" we are ready to support the eurozone countries to overcome the financial crisis and realize economic recovery , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters .
she described the european union as a " one of the major markets " for chinese foreign exchange investment in the future .
beijing has the world 's largest foreign exchange reserves at $ 2.65 trillion -lrb- 2 trillion euros -rrb- .
a significant proportion of that is invested in the euro .
annual trade talks between the eu and china took place earlier in the week .
chinese commerce minister chen deming said beijing was " very concerned " about the european debt crisis , and asked to see if " consensus can be translated into real action " to ensure recovery .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 23.12.2010 postcard from europe : east meets west in russia for christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year is the most popular holiday in russia in russia , christmas was only restored in the 1990s after the soviet union fell apart .
in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as south korea conducts more live-fire military drills , north korea threatens to wage a ' sacred ' nuclear war . the normally busy streets of seoul came to a halt during recent air raid drills . the practice occurs every month , but after north korea 's deadly shelling of yeonpyeong island , the threat of war seems much more serious now for many koreans . the tension this year began with the sinking in march of the south korean navy vessel , the cheonan , which killed 46 sailors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some analysts say north korea has been especially provocative this year because of the ongoing power transition as a result , conservative south korean president lee myung bak took an even harder line on north korea 's kim jong-il regime , cutting off business ties and pushing for international condemnation at the un . clear motivation for shelling of yeonpyeong but just as relations seemed to be improving this fall , artillery fell on yeonpyeong island . andrei lankov , a north korea analyst at seoul ’ s kookmin university , thinks pyongyang ’ s motivations for launching these attacks were clear . " north korea is not receiving aid from south korea and the united states , and it makes them increasingly dependent on china .
they are not desperate but they are dependent on china and don ’ t want this , so they are trying to create tensions , " he explained . lankov added that if pyongyang , which is currently in the midst of a power transition , thought washington and seoul felt threatened enough , they would have no choice but to resume engagement and start handing out material support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean border guards near the border village of panmunjom in paju " need to engage in dialogue " chung dong young , a former south korean minister of unification and a lawmaker in the main opposition party , said that the attacks this year had only been made possible because of president lee ’ s stance on the north . " if we really want to prevent war , we need the courage to engage in dialogue . " he said .
" with a dialogue , there would be no sound of gunfire .
the yeonpyeong shelling broke out during an absence of dialogue and in a heightened state of tension .
for the stability of the korean peninsula , we should immediately resume talks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and south korea regularly hold military drills that north korea routinely criticizes but chung added that it was not only south korea 's responsibility to engage the north .
he said the us has also failed to recognize pyongyang ’ s overtures . earlier this week , north korea reportedly told a visiting us politician that it would allow inspections of its nuclear facilities , a move seen as a way to jumpstart the stalled six-party denuclearization talks . but for now , both washington and seoul seem reluctant to re-engage .
south korea has vowed it will not tolerate any further provocations from the north . lankov predicted that there would be more such provocations .
" maybe in late spring .
this time , maybe for the first time in decades , there are good reasons to be afraid , just slightly afraid , of a real korean war , because the public mood in south korea is extremely tense . " he thought that this tension could push seoul into striking back harder than ever before . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 23.12.2010 postcard from europe : east meets west in russia for christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year is the most popular holiday in russia in russia , christmas was only restored in the 1990s after the soviet union fell apart .
in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group oxfam lets people donate animals or other goods to developing communities but has come under fire for the practice . shoppers looking to give philanthropic gifts often turn to charities and aid organizations during the holidays .
and the groups are more than happy to accept the donations , which they use to fund their work around the world . the international aid organization oxfam is no different .
if grandma has been getting your goat all year , the group 's oxfam unwrapped program lets you get her one - for 28 euros -lrb- $ 37 -rrb- .
but instead of shipping grandma the goat , it goes to a family or community in a developing country and she receives a card and a magnet . " so your grandma does n't really get a goat , but the money for the goat goes into oxfam 's project and supports people in poor countries where we work , " explained lisa jaspers , project coordinator of oxfam unwrapped in germany . oxfam 's website offers a choice of 37 gifts - ranging from 9 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , for a chicken , to 600 euros , for a classroom . jaspers said the concept makes donations more visible by showing an example of the kind of work aid groups do . helping people in need bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxfam sends cards and magnets to gift recipients since oxfam unwrapped began in 2004 in the uk , it 's raised over £ 60 million -lrb- 70 million euros , $ 92.6 million -rrb- for projects that improve the livelihoods , health and education of people in more than 60 countries . ntombizodwa marufu from zimbabwe received a gift of seven baby chickens two years ago . " yesterday i sold three chickens , " the mother of six said .
" i 've sold them at intervals to help uplift my family , to pay for school fees and food .
the eggs are really helpful for those of us who aren ’ t in good health , and we sell them too . " marufu , who lost her husband to hiv-related illnesses 14 years ago and is hiv-positive herself , said the chickens have made a big difference to her life . in addition to actual animals , oxfam also provides tools to improve education including desks , chairs , sports equipment , school furniture , teacher training , even toilets . the joy of giving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in pakistan left hundreds of thousands homeless nico jaspers , a 29-year-old german student , first heard about oxfam unwrapped when he was living in the uk , and said it was the perfect gift for a friend 's birthday . " we went camping in scotland and naomi 's tent was really messed up , so when her birthday came , we thought about a nice gift , " said nico .
but at the time , he was also aware of the extreme flooding in pakistan .
" i knew that there was this tent that you could give through oxfam unwrapped .
it 's giving , but not the anonymous kind where you just send a check , but something you can share and that they will remember and that has meaning . " the recipient , british student naomi ryland , 25 , said she thought it was a really original present . " i 've got this magnet now on my fridge with the picture of the tent which reminds me at the same time of our funny holiday and also of the good that came out of it at the end . " a paternalistic approach but oxfam unwrapped has also come under criticism .
british animal rights group animal aid said gift animals cause additional problems in poor communities stricken by drought .
while uk-based education charity worldwrite has labeled the oxfam unwrapped approach paternalistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deciding what goods - if any - to fly into developing nations proves difficult for ngos " the assumption is that people in the developing world are somehow different , have lesser needs , have lesser aspirations , want less development and somehow want gifts that are a repetition of the status quo - which is what subsistence life and rearing goats involves , " said ceri dingle , director of worldwrite and citizen tv channel world bites . she added that : " 99.9 percent of people who live a subsistence life - and that 's 70 percent of the developing world - want out of it .
what they really want is a chance to have what we have , for their kids to go to university , to get off the land and to not have to live a life of toil and subsistence .
there is nobody , except romantic westerners who think subsistence life is a life . " jaspers from oxfam said each situation in each country is different and they have to trust their local partner organizations to tell them what is needed . " we have four different categories - health , education , emergencies and securing livelihoods - we can use the money and the donations for what is needed the most in the countries , " jaspers said , adding that the group does n't send unlimited numbers of goats to one place simply because that 's what was bought online . worldwrite and oxfam , however , agreed that the gift giving is a way for people to feel good about giving something to people in the developing world . " we want to combine giving a donation with joy and fun - that you actually enjoy giving a donation and do n't feel pity , " jaspers said . author : cinnamon nippard / sms editor : sarah steffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as south korea conducts more live-fire military drills , north korea threatens to wage a ' sacred ' nuclear war . the normally busy streets of seoul came to a halt during recent air raid drills . the practice occurs every month , but after north korea 's deadly shelling of yeonpyeong island , the threat of war seems much more serious now for many koreans . the tension this year began with the sinking in march of the south korean navy vessel , the cheonan , which killed 46 sailors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some analysts say north korea has been especially provocative this year because of the ongoing power transition as a result , conservative south korean president lee myung bak took an even harder line on north korea 's kim jong-il regime , cutting off business ties and pushing for international condemnation at the un . clear motivation for shelling of yeonpyeong but just as relations seemed to be improving this fall , artillery fell on yeonpyeong island . andrei lankov , a north korea analyst at seoul ’ s kookmin university , thinks pyongyang ’ s motivations for launching these attacks were clear . " north korea is not receiving aid from south korea and the united states , and it makes them increasingly dependent on china .
they are not desperate but they are dependent on china and don ’ t want this , so they are trying to create tensions , " he explained . lankov added that if pyongyang , which is currently in the midst of a power transition , thought washington and seoul felt threatened enough , they would have no choice but to resume engagement and start handing out material support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean border guards near the border village of panmunjom in paju " need to engage in dialogue " chung dong young , a former south korean minister of unification and a lawmaker in the main opposition party , said that the attacks this year had only been made possible because of president lee ’ s stance on the north . " if we really want to prevent war , we need the courage to engage in dialogue . " he said .
" with a dialogue , there would be no sound of gunfire .
the yeonpyeong shelling broke out during an absence of dialogue and in a heightened state of tension .

south korea has vowed it will not tolerate any further provocations from the north . lankov predicted that there would be more such provocations .

in this week 's postcard from moscow , karen percy says the festive season brings an unusual mix of east meets west . russians take the festive season very seriously .
as in many other countries , it 's a time to buy presents , put up decorations and prepare feasts .
but this is a recent trend .
under communism , religious celebrations were discouraged .
nowadays , christmas is celebrated in line with the julian calendar , which means it falls on january 7 . all over moscow , the muzak rings out in shopping malls , restaurants and hotels .
you can hear classic favorites such as " jingle bells , " " silent night " and " santa claus is coming to town . " and the entire city center is illuminated .
kutuzovsky prospekt , one of the main arterial roads linking the city 's west with the center , is festooned with rows and rows of string lights in the red , white and blue of the russian flag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's karen percy says the holidays in moscow are exquisite outside the russian white house , where prime minister vladimir putin works , is a tall tree covered in blinking colored lights .
at red square , the old government department store glavnyi universalnyi magazin or gum is lit with even more lights than usual .
nearby skaters glide by on an ice skating rink set up especially for the occasion . rabbits all over for many decades , decorations were modest .
but now there are no limits .
store after store is crowded with some of the most exquisite ornaments i have ever seen .
there 's crystal and glass , glitter and gold .
there are rustic ornaments made of wood or seeds ; decorations featuring everything from ballerinas and soldiers to deer and dogs . not to mention the rabbits - there are oh so many rabbits this year : rabbits in hats , rabbit court jesters , rabbit princesses and even ice-skating rabbits . it 's to mark 2011 , the lunar year of the rabbit , and reflects the post-soviet fascination with astrology . changing traditions but despite the carols , decorations and the fact that it looks a lot like christmas , celebrations here are actually very different . for example , the russians do n't eat turkey .
instead , the main dish is kutya , a vegetable-based porridge eaten on christmas eve .
it might be followed by a supper of 12 different dishes to represent the 12 apostles . though you might hear about santa claus coming to town , the figure himself does not even exist in russian folklore .
a white-bearded gentleman called grandfather frost does , though , delivering gifts to the children on new year 's eve .
he 's also known as the russian spirit of winter and traditionally wears a blue suit .
but more and more , he 's adopted the red attire of his western counterpart . it 's a holdover from the bolsheviks .
when they initiated the revolution in 1917 , christmas celebrations on december 25 were banned , like so many other church activities .
they also prohibited the christmas tree , or yolka , brought to russia by peter the great in the 1600s .
so new year became a more significant holiday , as it is to this day . for me , one of the more positive aspects of the holidays here is that i am witnessing subtle changes in the gruff russian demeanor .
people are smiling .
they are showing small acts of kindness to one another .
they are enjoying themselves . author : karen percy editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that heritage is often lost in modern-day spain , but the manifesta festival is putting it back on the agenda . caught between two civilizations , southern spain has been fought over in the name of both christianity and islam .
today , it is seen as a bridge between north africa and europe , between two continents and two cultures .
it forms the perfect location for the eighth edition of manifesta , the roving european art festival , during which art exhibits , films , sculpture and performance work exploring the region 's identity are scattered between the town of murcia and the coastal city of cartagena .
more than 150 artists from around the world are taking part in the festival , which continues until january 9 , focusing their art on the historic relationship of conflict and coexistence between spain and north africa . murcia , the so-called orchard of europe , lies closer to algeria than madrid , spain 's capital .
founded by the moors in the 9th century , madinat mursiya flourished over the centuries and following the spanish reconquista became part of castile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many photographers and video artists participate in this year 's manifesta 8 dialogue instead of division in cartagena 's 18th-century former navy hospital , laurent grasso 's film tells of the city 's role as a surveillance port looking out towards north africa .
the paris-based artist switches between the past and the present as he draws out the fears and suspicions that consume both the city 's history and its present-day reality .
hedwig fijen , founding director of manifesta , said murcia had been chosen for this year 's location because of the growing cultural tensions across europe .
" the political situation in europe is changing .
i think we have forgotten a time in european history when there was coexistence , when there was no islamophobia , " she said .
" artists can investigate how these political problems have an effect on the daily lives of people .
through the eyes of the artists , we see a different perception . " a new way of looking at terrorism american artist michael takeo magruder 's controversial work focuses on the heart of the modern conflict .
his multimedia installation in cartegena 's modern art museum uses sound and pictures from the madrid train bombings in 2004 .
speaking about his work , magruder said that he wanted to create an alternative dialogue about terrorism away from the mainstream media .
" in our society , politicians use terrorist attacks for their own political purposes to sway the country , to get re-elected , to consolidate their power , " he said .
" the media often uses these attacks unethically . they create a tragic spectacle to boost ratings .
as artists we can provide an alternative space . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former artillery barracks in murcia exhibits artwork in a historic setting .
crossing cultures through art bouchra ouizguen , an artist from morocco , came to murcia to perform her work using dance and music to look at the role of women in islam , exploring the themes of friendship , isolation and pain .
the performance called " madame plaza " looks at the lives of four moroccan women interacting and exploring their own identities .
throughout the performance the wails of " aïta , " music inspired by moroccan folklore , echo around the stage in murcia 's former artillery barracks . from dance to cinema to sculpture and painting , manifesta is open to all kinds of artists and welcomes all visitors .
from the contemporary to the traditional , the festival seeks to include all forms of expression true to its founding mantra of co-existence and understanding .
the bi-annual festival was founded in the early 1990s in amsterdam after the fall of the berlin wall , the festival originally sought to forge artistic links between eastern and western europe .
this year , it is crossing over to north africa .
the organizers say they hope to use art where politics has failed and bring two cultures with a shared history in southern spain closer together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 23.12.2010 spanish builder acs plays divide and conquer at hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders say workers ' worst fears have been removed hochtief 's works council is angry that german builders ' union ig bau has dropped its opposition to a takeover bid from spanish company acs .
the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

but a couple of obstacles still have to be cleared before it can come into force . russian leaders on thursday welcomed the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- by the united states senate , with top lawmakers saying the ratification process could start before the end of the week .
the news agency interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying the new start " will not only further russian and us security , but it will have a positive effect on international security and stability . "
a spokeswoman for president dmitry medvedev said he welcomed the ratification " with satisfaction " and " expressed hope that the duma and federation council are ready to examine this question and ratify the document . "
under the accord , russia and the united states pledge to cut their stockpile of active nuclear warheads to 1,550 within seven years , or about 30 percent from when the first start , signed in 1991 , expired a year ago .
both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the duma may approve the new start this week medvedev and us president barack obama signed the new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .
russian ratification near the us senate on wednesday voted 71-26 to ratify the treaty , giving obama a major foreign policy victory before the current senate adjourns and his democrats lose several seats to newly-elected republicans in january .
democratic leaders in the senate allowed some non-binding amendments to the original document to secure more republican support .
these included a recommitment to deploying a missile defense system , modernization of the current nuclear arsenal and seeking new talks with russia on limiting tactical nuclear weapons .
while there is some opposition to the treaty among opposition parties in the duma , medvedev 's united russia party enjoys a strong majority and the body was widely expected to approve it .
but konstantin kosachev , chairman of the duma 's foreign affairs committee , said russian lawmakers would need to study and respond to the amendments made by their american counterparts before giving their final approval .
the treaty 's first reading and debate in the duma was scheduled for december 24 .
" further work on the ratification bill will continue once the duma resumes its work in january , " news agencies quoted kosachev as saying .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .
the ministry 's leadership has apparently not seen or approved the document , and it does not represent the ministry 's position .
" this is not the path we 're following , " the statement said .
permanent financial security in addition to germany , finland , france , ireland and the netherlands are working on various proposals .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is to discuss the plans with his french counterpart lagarde on thursday in strasbourg , the report said .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .
we better get used to harsh winters ... climate change ! - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 23.12.2010 spanish builder acs plays divide and conquer at hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders say workers ' worst fears have been removed hochtief 's works council is angry that german builders ' union ig bau has dropped its opposition to a takeover bid from spanish company acs .
the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

there were further chances for cottbus , and the visitors were able to make the pressure count with shao 's goal on 40 minutes and a second for germany under-21 player petersen on 43 minutes .
wolfsburg attempted a comeback in the second half , but were only able to manage a consolation goal through edin dzeko in the 56th minute , and the game ended 3-1 .
after eight games without a win , former england manager mcclaren 's future with the club is in doubt .
" it was just not good enough today ; it was not good enough throughout the whole first half of the season , " mcclaren said after the match .
" i am disappointed and frustrated . "

returning after a 10-week injury layoff , substitute miroslav klose slotted the ball home on 52 minutes after a defensive error by stuttgart captain matthias delpierre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a hard-fought match , but bayern came out on top stuttgart went down to ten men soon afterwards with a second booking for khalid boulahrouz .
there was further bad news for the side when a penalty against bayern , taken by christian gentner was saved by keeper hans-joerg butt .
delpierre , who himself was sent off three minutes from the end of the match , equalized on 77 minutes with a header .
however , bayern were to have the final say with goals from thomas mueller and franck ribery , plus a second for klose , making the final score 6-3 .

meanwhile , there was no shortage of goals as bayern munich met stuttgart . there was disappointment for three top flight bundesliga sides - cologne , wolfsburg and frankfurt - who all went out of the german cup to second division opposition on wednesday evening .
wolfsburg exited germany 's main soccer cup competition after a defeat to visitors energie cottbus , piling pressure on club coach steve mcclaren .
cottbus were 3-0 up against the wolves by half time , thanks to goals from nils petersen and jiayi shao .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcclaren expressed frustration at his side 's performance peterson opened the scoring , heading the ball in from a corner kick to leave wolfsburg visibly shocked .
there were further chances for cottbus , and the visitors were able to make the pressure count with shao 's goal on 40 minutes and a second for germany under-21 player petersen on 43 minutes .
wolfsburg attempted a comeback in the second half , but were only able to manage a consolation goal through edin dzeko in the 56th minute , and the game ended 3-1 .
after eight games without a win , former england manager mcclaren 's future with the club is in doubt .
" it was just not good enough today ; it was not good enough throughout the whole first half of the season , " mcclaren said after the match .
" i am disappointed and frustrated . "
duisburg and aachen go through cologne also fell prey to an early goal when stefan maierhofer gave duisburg 's " zebras " the lead after just three minutes , scoring from a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne , like wolfsburg , only managed one consolation goal julian koch headed in a second for the visitors in the 76th minute and , despite considerable pressure , cologne were only able to pull back one goal when a fierce shot from youngster simon terrode on 84 minutes found its way across the line .
alemannia aachen 's match against eintracht frankfurt was settled with a penalty shoot-out after extra time ended in a 1-1 draw , the goals scored by aachen 's marco hoeger and frankfurt 's martin fenin .

russian pavel pogrebnyak narrowed that lead on 31 minutes and leveled the score with his second , just before the half-time whistle .
returning after a 10-week injury layoff , substitute miroslav klose slotted the ball home on 52 minutes after a defensive error by stuttgart captain matthias delpierre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a hard-fought match , but bayern came out on top stuttgart went down to ten men soon afterwards with a second booking for khalid boulahrouz .
there was further bad news for the side when a penalty against bayern , taken by christian gentner was saved by keeper hans-joerg butt .
delpierre , who himself was sent off three minutes from the end of the match , equalized on 77 minutes with a header .
however , bayern were to have the final say with goals from thomas mueller and franck ribery , plus a second for klose , making the final score 6-3 .
draw made for the next round with two games in the last 16 postponed because of poor weather , the draw was made late on wednesday evening for the quarter-final stage of the competition .

the victors of the postponed koblenz - kaiserslautern match will head to duisburg .
schalke , meanwhile , drew the winner of the postponed offenbach versus nuremberg tie .
the venue will be determined by which team wins , as german cup rules guarantee home advantage to clubs outside the professional divisions , like offenbach .

he 's also a member of the council on foreign relations .
deutsche welle : the start treaty was passed with a majority of 71 votes - were you surprised ?
thomas mann : no , the last couple of days have seen a movement among republicans to support ratification of the treaty and it seemed likely that they would get at least 70 and possibly higher .
it was n't the kind of near unanimous vote that we 're used to having on arms control treaties .
but given the extraordinary effort by the no. 1 and 2 republican leaders in the senate against ratification i think it 's a significant achievement . for a long time it looked as if the obama administration would not get the majority of the votes .
what was the tipping point ?
the administration had been working for months with senator jon kyl who was sort of the policy leader on this front … it had been negotiating with him with the expectation that reasonable compromises addressing concerns such as freedom to move ahead on missile defense and modernizing our nuclear weapons … that the republicans would fall in line , but as we got closer to the end of the 111th congress it became increasingly apparent that kyl was going to do everything in his power to prevent any action from occurring and pushing it into the next congress where prospects would diminish given the nature of the new members coming and those leaving .
at that point the administration started working seriously working with other republicans who would more naturally respond to the strong support for its ratification among very prominent former republican national security officials .
contrary to what the republicans argue , the treaty was not rushed through .
no , there were a large number of hearings conducted , there were ample opportunities for additional debate and consideration .
my own view is that for most of the senators reluctant to play ball it was more a desire to deny the president a victory than it was serious concerns about the substance of the treaty .
so it was not about substance but about political wrangling ?
that is right .
they argued it on substance , but each of the issues raised were answered and with impressive arguments and evidence … there was n't in the end a serious substantive argument against it .
and that 's why some of the senators like john mccain and lindsey graham ended up looking petulant .
it was embarrassing that senator lindsey graham was complaining about the productivity of a lame duck session , that so many things were accomplished that president obama was not further wounded but was strengthened .
have you ever seen this kind of wrangling during the last days of a congress before ?
yes i have - the ending of a legislative session is oftentimes a mess especially in the senate .
it 's a very partisan era of american politics , parties are deeply polarized , and engaged in partisan war to an extent we have n't seen over a century .
but was what is striking is how productive the 111th congress has been … the initial and the second stimulus , health care reform , financial regulation and a series of other domestic policy achievements , managing to get the defense authorization bill passed , the do n't ask do n't tell policy repealed and the new start treaty ratified is quite an achievement .
so for those who see nothing but dysfunction in our politics it 's important to realize that the combination and party polarization and senate filibusters makes it very difficult for a majority to achieve its objectives .
and certainly a number of items like climate change legislation and immigration were not achieved and nonetheless inspite of all of that and the perfectly dreadful way the process appears to the public , i think that the president and the democrats can be pleased that they have ended a very productive congress .
you mentioned president obama - how important is this ratification for him , after all , he invested a lot in supporting this treaty ?
i think it 's important .
this is one in which he really stuck to his guns .
he just would n't accept no for an answer .
he said it was critically important to american national security .
our standing in the world , our relations with russia , and our policies and efforts with iran and north korea , he really raised the stakes for himself in pushing ahead with this - it has to be a boost to him , certainly countries around the world will look upon this as a major achievement and feel a bit more comfortable working with the president .
is the start treaty more of a symbolic act ?
how important is it really for the us-russian relations and for nuclear proliferation ?
it 's not a dramatically ambitious agreement , but it needed to be passed , if only to maintain inspection regimes , it 's mainly to keep relations and negotiations with the russians alive and to maintain credibility in the world for trying to deal with problems of nuclear proliferation .
it 's not that the achievement itself was substantively historic , but it 's agreement and ratification are very important for the broader security agenda .
does this turn the year around for him ?
it certainly means that the setback from the midterm election which is real but is largely driven by the economic conditions in this country that that setback is in no way going to paralyze him for months or a full year .
he can take a punch , he 's absorbed the loss but he 's pushing ahead .
he 'll find congress much more difficult to work with with the republican majority in the house and a diminished democratic majority in the senate .
he 'll be playing defense as far as some of his achievements in the 111th congress -lsb- are concerned -rsb- .
he 'll almost certainly be turning to areas where he has the authority to act alone as the chief executive and head of the administrative process of government .
i think it 's also the case in getting some additional stimulus out of congress and we 'll likely see some economic growth and a decline of the unemployment rate over the next year or so as we lead up to the presidential election year and that will certainly strengthen his position going into reelection .

the vote was accompanied by strikes and protests due to wage cuts and tax hikes . greek lawmakers approved a tough austerity budget early on thursday to comply with the demands imposed as part of an international bailout to the debt-ridden country .
the new budget for 2011 was debated for five days before being adopted by 156 votes to 142 .
the ruling socialist party backed the measures in the face of opposition from the right and left .
some 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- will be cut from the government budget in an attempt to reduce greece 's deficit from 15.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 7.4 percent .
this follows austerity measures introduced earlier this year .
greek prime minister george papandreou said that the country was in the grip of a " deep crisis , " and urged the opposition to join with his party in the " race " to save the nation for future generations .
" i am more determined than ever to change greece , " papandreou said .
" we will not go bankrupt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou narrowly got his spending cuts through parliament conservative opposition leader antonis samaras argued that austerity - and taxes - were crippling the greek economy .
" the way out of this crisis lies in growth , " said samaras .
some 3,000 union members and communists staged separate demonstrations on wednesday to call for the budget to be rejected .
bus and subway drivers in athens staged their fourth strike this month against wage cuts .
the cuts are one aspect of the austerity measures that greece put in place as a condition for receiving a 110-billion-euro bailout from the imf and eu .

now an ngo is trying to increase farm income through beekeeping , while saving threatened local bee populations at the same time . monsoon is somar devji maghi 's favourite time of year .
an iridescent green has swept across the ground and for the next four months , somar will plant , turn soil and watch his farm grow .
the 26-year-old lives in dandwal , a small village in gujarat , in india 's south .
somar wishes he could spend his whole year here but he ca n't grow enough to support the family .
when monsoon ends he works on other people 's farms making just 60 rupees – or one euro – a day .
as india pushes forward with its quest for development , small farmers like somar are getting left behind , according to vijaya pastala .
" gujarat is the fastest growing state but there are still many tribal villages that do n't have electricity .
not many finish school , not many go to college , women are married early .
a lot of them are loan-dependent , money-lender-dependent . "
a sustainable solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many tribal villages without electricity vijaya pastala is the ceo of under the mango tree -lrb- utmt -rrb- , a company that links organic small farms to a national market .
after witnessing tribal life in gujarat , vijaya was determined to help .
in march 2009 she launched the not-for-profit bees for poverty reduction program .
farmers buy a starter kit of two bright blue bee boxes at 2,500 rupees or 42 euros .
they then undergo an intensive training program , where they learn how to find , capture , box and care for the indigenous bee – apis cerena .
beekeeping in india is not like beekeeping in the west .
there is no protective suit , it 's just your bare skin up against thousands of potentially angry bees .
it takes patience , persistence and courage . " i 've been stung up to 100 times in a single day when boxing hives , " utmt 's bee expert atar singh said .
however , as jhula mahado found out , the pain pays off when you hit pay dirt for the first time .
for months , jhula has been carefully tending his hive .
every two days he checks the combs making sure that they are sheltered from the wind and rain .
each day he watched as swarms of black and gold entered the box carrying packs of pollen .
as atar opens the box to show , more than 45 thousands bees swarm around rich yellow combs , oozing with honey .
the combs are cut and the honey extracted .
jhula will make 16 euros from this batch .
he should be able to collect honey every 15 to 20 days for the next four months .
it 's a huge boost to his average annual income , which is less than 170 euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh honey makes up for numerous painful bee stings more than just honey according to atar , the rewards of beekeeping go even further .
" honey is just a by product or direct advantage to the beekeepers .
the indirect advantages are much more , even in terms of monetary benefits .
having bees helps to increase their agricultural productivity through pollination .
bees are responsible for 80 percent pollination for the crop , which increases about 35 to 40 percent of yield , " he explained .
more importantly , atar said , beekeeping is helping his favourite bee , apis cerena , make a long- needed comeback .
the cerena is an indigenous indian bee – famous for its small size and ability to crawl into delicate flowers .
but their population is dwindling due to loss of habitat and disease .
one of the worst health scares , atar explained , started in 1972 with the introduction of apis mellifera – a european bee .
" apis mellifera could actually produce 75 to 85 kilos of honey versus apis cerena which could only produce 5 to 7 kilos of honey .
but within six months a viral disease known as sad brood had been introduced and it caused a lot of harm to the indigenous bee population . "
the other threat has been india 's tradition of honey hunting .
searching for gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the population of india 's indigenous bee is dwindling somu sotru is a traditional honey hunter .
he goes into the forest , finds a hive , smokes it until the bees leave and then crushes it to get the honey .
" we go into the forest with an axe and cut the honey comb .
we squeeze the honey and throw the combs away .
we collect it into plastic bags and then sell it , " somu said .
somu has two bee boxes on his farm , but when atar opens them , the hives are empty and covered in white webs , created by wax moths .
somu lacks the patience required to care for bees , and still views honey hunting as a quick fix .
although some older farmers like somu remain unconvinced of the benefits of beekeeping , others like somar devji maghi have embraced the opportunity .
the program has trained 600 farmers , out of which 100 are master trainers like somar .
they help farmers catch , keep and care for the bees .
" now it 's just seven people who have taken up this activity .
i want more people to take up this activity , as well as the landless .
i want the activities to be so good that you take the name of our village everywhere you go , " somar said .
somar has already noticed an increase of productivity this year .
he has collected cucumbers every three days , compared to every six and hopes to have eight to ten bee boxes on his farm by the end of next year .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .
the ministry 's leadership has apparently not seen or approved the document , and it does not represent the ministry 's position .
" this is not the path we 're following , " the statement said .
permanent financial security in addition to germany , finland , france , ireland and the netherlands are working on various proposals .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is to discuss the plans with his french counterpart lagarde on thursday in strasbourg , the report said .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov welcomed news of the ratification but said that moscow would need time to " study " the us document wording , noting that there had been a change in the text since its initial draft . german chancellor angela merkel hailed the news as an " important milestone in the development of a true partnership with russia , " with the treaty to play a part in nato 's strategic concept .
merkel added that she hoped the treaty would lead to further disarmament . ' a decade of disarmament ' german foreign minister guido westerwelle claimed that the vote " sets the course for a decade of disarmament and affirms president obama 's vision for a world free of nuclear weapons . " " we are counting on russia to now also ratify the treaty quickly , " westerwelle said , adding that germany would use its place on the united nations security council for the next two years to push for disarmament and arms control . nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said that the decision would make a " significant contribution " to regional security and that it would lead to " progress on conventional and nuclear arms control initiatives . "

" i am confident that our nation 's security , and that of the world , will be enhanced by ratifying this treaty , " he said .
the treaty " is not simply an agreement to address the lingering dangers of the old nuclear age .
it is an agreement that will give us a crucial tool to combat the threats of this new nuclear age . " obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

that heritage is often lost in modern-day spain , but the manifesta festival is putting it back on the agenda . caught between two civilizations , southern spain has been fought over in the name of both christianity and islam .
today , it is seen as a bridge between north africa and europe , between two continents and two cultures .
it forms the perfect location for the eighth edition of manifesta , the roving european art festival , during which art exhibits , films , sculpture and performance work exploring the region 's identity are scattered between the town of murcia and the coastal city of cartagena .
more than 150 artists from around the world are taking part in the festival , which continues until january 9 , focusing their art on the historic relationship of conflict and coexistence between spain and north africa . murcia , the so-called orchard of europe , lies closer to algeria than madrid , spain 's capital .
founded by the moors in the 9th century , madinat mursiya flourished over the centuries and following the spanish reconquista became part of castile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many photographers and video artists participate in this year 's manifesta 8 dialogue instead of division in cartagena 's 18th-century former navy hospital , laurent grasso 's film tells of the city 's role as a surveillance port looking out towards north africa .
the paris-based artist switches between the past and the present as he draws out the fears and suspicions that consume both the city 's history and its present-day reality .
hedwig fijen , founding director of manifesta , said murcia had been chosen for this year 's location because of the growing cultural tensions across europe .
" the political situation in europe is changing .
i think we have forgotten a time in european history when there was coexistence , when there was no islamophobia , " she said .
" artists can investigate how these political problems have an effect on the daily lives of people .
through the eyes of the artists , we see a different perception . " a new way of looking at terrorism american artist michael takeo magruder 's controversial work focuses on the heart of the modern conflict .
his multimedia installation in cartegena 's modern art museum uses sound and pictures from the madrid train bombings in 2004 .
speaking about his work , magruder said that he wanted to create an alternative dialogue about terrorism away from the mainstream media .
" in our society , politicians use terrorist attacks for their own political purposes to sway the country , to get re-elected , to consolidate their power , " he said .
" the media often uses these attacks unethically . they create a tragic spectacle to boost ratings .
as artists we can provide an alternative space . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former artillery barracks in murcia exhibits artwork in a historic setting .
crossing cultures through art bouchra ouizguen , an artist from morocco , came to murcia to perform her work using dance and music to look at the role of women in islam , exploring the themes of friendship , isolation and pain .
the performance called " madame plaza " looks at the lives of four moroccan women interacting and exploring their own identities .
throughout the performance the wails of " aïta , " music inspired by moroccan folklore , echo around the stage in murcia 's former artillery barracks . from dance to cinema to sculpture and painting , manifesta is open to all kinds of artists and welcomes all visitors .
from the contemporary to the traditional , the festival seeks to include all forms of expression true to its founding mantra of co-existence and understanding .
the bi-annual festival was founded in the early 1990s in amsterdam after the fall of the berlin wall , the festival originally sought to forge artistic links between eastern and western europe .
this year , it is crossing over to north africa .
the organizers say they hope to use art where politics has failed and bring two cultures with a shared history in southern spain closer together .

under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.12.2010 french city implements new public parking spot sensors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse hopes to make finding a parking spot easier toulouse , in the south of france , hopes to install 70 public parking spot sensors early next year .
the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .

but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .

the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .

governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .

some wonder if the harsh winters are caused by climate change , while others ponder ways to deal with it . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .
we better get used to harsh winters ... climate change ! - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .
the ministry 's leadership has apparently not seen or approved the document , and it does not represent the ministry 's position .
" this is not the path we 're following , " the statement said .
permanent financial security in addition to germany , finland , france , ireland and the netherlands are working on various proposals .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is to discuss the plans with his french counterpart lagarde on thursday in strasbourg , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german finance ministry said the documents quoted do not represent its position the newspaper quoted lagarde in a separate article as saying : " we will discuss how we can work more closely together . "
the eu set up a 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- rescue fund with the help of the international monetary fund in the fallout from the greek debt crisis , but it runs for only three years .
at an eu summit earlier this month , leaders agreed to replace the emergency fund with a permanent mechanism from mid-2013 but the precise details are yet to be agreed .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .

at an eu summit earlier this month , leaders agreed to replace the emergency fund with a permanent mechanism from mid-2013 but the precise details are yet to be agreed .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "
soukrou said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .

this comes as the number of deaths in post-election violence continued to climb . the united nations human rights council on thursday condemned " the atrocities " that have occurred in ivory coast since the country 's disputed presidential election last month .
led by nigeria on behalf of other african nations , the 47-member council reached a consensus and adopted the resolution without putting it to a vote .
the resolution " strongly condemns human rights violations that have taken place in ivory coast " including abductions , sexual violence and the loss of life .
" it is regrettable that the current political impasse instills a palpable fear of further escalation of the human rights situation , " said nigerian diplomat ositadinma anaedu .
the un had previously substantiated allegations of 173 killings and 90 cases of torture or ill treatment in ivory coast since dec .
16 , un deputy human rights chief kyung-wha kang told reporters at the council 's meeting .
there were also 500 reports of arrests or disappearances in the country over the past week .
sending a message on violence " the international community has sent a message to those in ivory coast who use violence as a means to achieve their objective that this will not be tolerated , " us ambassador betty king said .
on wednesday , both germany and france urged their nationals to leave the country provisionally amid concerns that the violence was spiraling out of control .
it 's not clear how many german nationals are affected , but there are believed to be around 13,000 french nationals in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community largely supports ouattara the escalation in tensions began after a presidential election in late november , when incumbent laurent gbagbo faced off against his opponent , alassane ouattara .
the international community largely supports ouattara , whom they say won the election .
but gbagbo has refused to step down .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has warned that ivory coast could slide into a civil war ; he has accused gbagbo of trying to force un peacekeepers out of the country and of blocking supplies to the troops .
for his part , ouattara has called for widespread public uprisings and civil disobedience from his supporters .
un refugees agency reports that thousands of women and children have begun fleeing the country 's post-election violence , heading for camps in liberia and guinea .
meanwhile , on thursday , an ivorian army spokesman said the military stands united behind the incumbent .
underlying ethnic differences yet far from being a sudden and unexpected conflagration , observers say the election and its disputed results reflect ethnic and religious differences that have long been brewing under the surface of the relatively peaceful and prosperous ivory coast .
ivory coast is the world 's largest cocoa producer .
its thriving industry boosted the living standards there so much that it has become an immigration hub for people from other , poorer african countries , such as mali and burkina faso .
some of these people shared ethnic and religious ties to those living in the largely muslim northern part of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent gbagbo has placed friends in powerful positions in turn , many people in the south of the ivory coast have started to demand protection for their national heritage - their " ivorian-ness . "
that clumsy phrase - and the racial , economic and religious questions attached to determining who can be considered to be truly from the ivory coast or not - has been at the center of the ivorian political struggle since the end of the 1990s .
ouattara 's broad international support reaches back to his time as the vice director of the international monetary fund , from 1994 to 1999 , and as a leader of the ivory coast government in the 1990s .
international observers consider him to be an experienced diplomat and politician , who can handle himself well on the world political stage .
candidate from the north his family is from the north of the country , and " ado , " as the ivorians call him , gets most of his support from the northern and central part of the country .
ouattara was n't allowed to run for office in the 2000 election ; the country 's highest court blocked his bid saying he is n't really of ivorian heritage .
since then , the notion of " ivorian-ness " has been an argument used to keep undesirable candidates from running for office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-government supporters are led by charles ble goude that ideology holds not only for politics , but also for the armed forces .
in the multicultural ivorian society , this means about a quarter of the population does not have some of the privileges afforded to others , and is systematically discriminated against .
that discrimination also gained ouattara support from second-generation immigrants , who are fighting for their rights to full citizenship .
this ethno-political conflict is what underlies the current crisis , says political expert gilles yabi of the international crisis group .
it is also the main reason for the creation of the rainbow-rebellion movement " forces nouvelles , " says yabi .
in 2002 , the gbagbo government attacked them , and fought from the north toward abidjan .
yabi says the connection is significant for anyone who wants to understand the current confrontation .
" one of the most important political demands of the forces nouvelles during the armed conflict was the question of nationality .
the question was which candidate was allowed to run at all , and whether alassane ouattara should be one of them .
that means , from the very beginning , the armed struggle of the forces nouvelles was tied to ouattara 's political struggle to have his nationality recognized , " yabi said .
candidate from the south laurent gbagbo 's stronghold is in the southern part of the country .
he has been in power since he wrested it from then-military leader general guei in 2000 .
at the time , gbagbo was considered the great hope of the resistance movement against the one-party system .
jeremy soukrou is a gbagbo adherent ; he organized open debates prior to the election in order to promote gbagbo 's cause .
" we agree with and support the program of president gbagbo .
and we are ready to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , and defend his life - in a certain way , to defend the civil society in our country . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocoa has made the country relatively prosperous and stable both camps are clearly ready to use violence to support their views .
a militia of young men who call themselves " young patriots " has joined forces behind gbagbo , under the command of the charismatic charles ble goude , whom gbagbo has named youth minister .
when goude now goes through the neighborhoods of abidjan calling for " total freedom " for the ivory coast , the violence can be turned against political opponents - but it can also turn against foreigners or un soldiers .
benefits of joining gbagbo many of these youths get involved in the hope that their support will bring them more opportunities in the future , perhaps even one of the few jobs available in the country .
" the supporters of gbagbo get a whole array of privileges for their help , " yabi said , including money or a career push for a loyal soldier .
gbagbo also has the republican guard on his side .
the group is also part of the ivorian army , and is meant to protect state institutions .
furthermore , a paramilitary elite troop called cecos , which operates against organized crime in abidjan , is sometimes used by gbagbo as a private militia .
gbagbo , who has filled key public positions with friends and supporters , continues to find support in these ranks .
but if the internatioal community isolates him and continues to pressure him , some say the base constituency could begin to fall apart .

that heritage is often lost in modern-day spain , but the manifesta festival is putting it back on the agenda . caught between two civilizations , southern spain has been fought over in the name of both christianity and islam .
today , it is seen as a bridge between north africa and europe , between two continents and two cultures .
it forms the perfect location for the eighth edition of manifesta , the roving european art festival , during which art exhibits , films , sculpture and performance work exploring the region 's identity are scattered between the town of murcia and the coastal city of cartagena .
more than 150 artists from around the world are taking part in the festival , which continues until january 9 , focusing their art on the historic relationship of conflict and coexistence between spain and north africa . murcia , the so-called orchard of europe , lies closer to algeria than madrid , spain 's capital .
founded by the moors in the 9th century , madinat mursiya flourished over the centuries and following the spanish reconquista became part of castile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many photographers and video artists participate in this year 's manifesta 8 dialogue instead of division in cartagena 's 18th-century former navy hospital , laurent grasso 's film tells of the city 's role as a surveillance port looking out towards north africa .
the paris-based artist switches between the past and the present as he draws out the fears and suspicions that consume both the city 's history and its present-day reality .
hedwig fijen , founding director of manifesta , said murcia had been chosen for this year 's location because of the growing cultural tensions across europe .
" the political situation in europe is changing .
i think we have forgotten a time in european history when there was coexistence , when there was no islamophobia , " she said .
" artists can investigate how these political problems have an effect on the daily lives of people .
through the eyes of the artists , we see a different perception . " a new way of looking at terrorism american artist michael takeo magruder 's controversial work focuses on the heart of the modern conflict .
his multimedia installation in cartegena 's modern art museum uses sound and pictures from the madrid train bombings in 2004 .
speaking about his work , magruder said that he wanted to create an alternative dialogue about terrorism away from the mainstream media .
" in our society , politicians use terrorist attacks for their own political purposes to sway the country , to get re-elected , to consolidate their power , " he said .
" the media often uses these attacks unethically . they create a tragic spectacle to boost ratings .
as artists we can provide an alternative space . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former artillery barracks in murcia exhibits artwork in a historic setting .
crossing cultures through art bouchra ouizguen , an artist from morocco , came to murcia to perform her work using dance and music to look at the role of women in islam , exploring the themes of friendship , isolation and pain .
the performance called " madame plaza " looks at the lives of four moroccan women interacting and exploring their own identities .
throughout the performance the wails of " aïta , " music inspired by moroccan folklore , echo around the stage in murcia 's former artillery barracks . from dance to cinema to sculpture and painting , manifesta is open to all kinds of artists and welcomes all visitors .
from the contemporary to the traditional , the festival seeks to include all forms of expression true to its founding mantra of co-existence and understanding .
the bi-annual festival was founded in the early 1990s in amsterdam after the fall of the berlin wall , the festival originally sought to forge artistic links between eastern and western europe .
this year , it is crossing over to north africa .
the organizers say they hope to use art where politics has failed and bring two cultures with a shared history in southern spain closer together .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de brands -pipe- 23.12.2010 dutch brewery allowed to continue selling " bavaria " beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria is known for its beer bavaria is famous for its beer , but buy a " bavaria " and it wo n't have come from the southern german state .
after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .
controversial director roman polanski has filmed twice at the studios and said , " studio babelsberg has highly talented and enthusiastic crews as well as young talents full of motivation . "
in addition to a regular roster of german films , major hollywood productions such as " the pianist , " " inglorious basterds " and " the ghostwriter " have all drawn on a century of cinema expertise at studio babelsberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.12.2010 french city implements new public parking spot sensors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse hopes to make finding a parking spot easier toulouse , in the south of france , hopes to install 70 public parking spot sensors early next year .
the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the devices will let residents check to see if there are free parking spaces on public streets . as european drivers bounce around their city doing their last-minute shopping , there 's always something that causes even more stress : parking on city streets .
after all , sometimes it can feel like it takes forever to find a parking spot , especially on those narrow and tough-to-navigate city centers .
but a new piece of french technology may put an end to the headache of looking for a city parking spot .
the device indicates free places to drivers on their cell phones by using space technology that was originally developed to help balloons park on the planet venus .
the new device , lyberta , is currently being tested on the streets of the southern french city of toulouse .
it works through a series of tiny receptors that are planted just under the pavement .
the receptors can tell whether a vehicle is parked over them by measuring their magnetic field .
they transmit that information to an electronic box on the block , which relays it to a central server .
the server then sends the information out to your telephone in real time .
" this car has been here since 8 a.m. this morning , and here 's one that 's been parked here since november 25th , " explains tony marchand , the technical director of the start-up company that is developing project .
marchand says the device can also recognize whether a vehicle is a car or a truck , from their different magnetic profiles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a french government study shows that 60 percent of urban pollution is due to idling cars limited trials for now for now , there are only four sensors installed under toulouse 's streets , but starting early next year , the city will put in 70 more and hook them up with a pool of 80 users .
the eventual goal is to cover the entire city , although that may take time as each sensor costs about 100 euros -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- each .
marchand says one of lyberta 's advantages is that it uses radio waves instead of gps , so it does n't need a satellite hook up , and that means it 's more reliable , and cheaper to operate .
marchand says the us sometimes shuts off the gps network for military secrecy reasons .
but more commonly , gps is often less effective down on city streets because of what is known as the canyoning effect - when large buildings block the signal .
alexandre marciel , toulouse 's deputy mayor is very excited about the project , which stemmed from an idea he had several years ago to try to ease gridlock on toulouse 's narrow downtown streets .
" the system is very simple , " he said .
" you just have to look on your cell phone and you know , in real time , if a parking spot is free or not . ”
marciel says that will help cut down on time spent driving around looking for a parking space and the extra pollution this causes .
idling cars contribute to air pollution french government studies show that 60 percent of urban pollution in france is due to idling cars searching for a place to park , which translates into 700 million wasted hours a year , notes marciel .
the device will also help the town to better manage its public parking system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toulouse is the home of france 's aerospace and space science research marciel adds french cities on average collect money from only about a third of their parking spaces .
" but it 's more than money , " he says .
" anarchic parking eats away at the quality of life of a town . "
marciel says the system will also let drivers pay for parking without using cash or a credit card , by just putting a chip on their windshield .
it will also recognize certain categories of vehicles like ambulances and handicapped cars , and allow them to park for free .
origins in space science lyberta would have been possible without the cooperation of the french space agency , known as the cnes -lrb- centre nationale d 'etudes spatiales -rrb- , whose headquarters are located in toulouse .
antonio guell is in charge of bringing space research down to earth for the good of the public .
he says lyberta took advantage of two space technologies that were developed and patented over the last decade .
" these technologies were developed to help stratospheric balloons land on venus and communicate with each other without using heavy duty transmission equipment , " says guell .
guell says the balloons never made it to venus for budgetary reasons .
but their technology may soon be helping cars find parking spots in toulouse and other cities in europe and canada that are interested in the project .
but , there 's one thing drivers may not appreciate , says guell : lyberta will also be able to tell the police when they do n't feed the parking meter .

the vote was accompanied by strikes and protests due to wage cuts and tax hikes . greek lawmakers approved a tough austerity budget early on thursday to comply with the demands imposed as part of an international bailout to the debt-ridden country .
the new budget for 2011 was debated for five days before being adopted by 156 votes to 142 .
the ruling socialist party backed the measures in the face of opposition from the right and left .
some 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- will be cut from the government budget in an attempt to reduce greece 's deficit from 15.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 7.4 percent .
this follows austerity measures introduced earlier this year .
greek prime minister george papandreou said that the country was in the grip of a " deep crisis , " and urged the opposition to join with his party in the " race " to save the nation for future generations .
" i am more determined than ever to change greece , " papandreou said .
" we will not go bankrupt . "

bus and subway drivers in athens staged their fourth strike this month against wage cuts .
the cuts are one aspect of the austerity measures that greece put in place as a condition for receiving a 110-billion-euro bailout from the imf and eu .

but a couple of obstacles still have to be cleared before it can come into force . russian leaders on thursday welcomed the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- by the united states senate , with top lawmakers saying the ratification process could start before the end of the week .
the news agency interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying the new start " will not only further russian and us security , but it will have a positive effect on international security and stability . "
a spokeswoman for president dmitry medvedev said he welcomed the ratification " with satisfaction " and " expressed hope that the duma and federation council are ready to examine this question and ratify the document . "
under the accord , russia and the united states pledge to cut their stockpile of active nuclear warheads to 1,550 within seven years , or about 30 percent from when the first start , signed in 1991 , expired a year ago .
both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the duma may approve the new start this week medvedev and us president barack obama signed the new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .
russian ratification near the us senate on wednesday voted 71-26 to ratify the treaty , giving obama a major foreign policy victory before the current senate adjourns and his democrats lose several seats to newly-elected republicans in january .
democratic leaders in the senate allowed some non-binding amendments to the original document to secure more republican support .
these included a recommitment to deploying a missile defense system , modernization of the current nuclear arsenal and seeking new talks with russia on limiting tactical nuclear weapons .
while there is some opposition to the treaty among opposition parties in the duma , medvedev 's united russia party enjoys a strong majority and the body was widely expected to approve it .
but konstantin kosachev , chairman of the duma 's foreign affairs committee , said russian lawmakers would need to study and respond to the amendments made by their american counterparts before giving their final approval .
the treaty 's first reading and debate in the duma was scheduled for december 24 .
" further work on the ratification bill will continue once the duma resumes its work in january , " news agencies quoted kosachev as saying .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .

now an ngo is trying to increase farm income through beekeeping , while saving threatened local bee populations at the same time . monsoon is somar devji maghi 's favourite time of year .
an iridescent green has swept across the ground and for the next four months , somar will plant , turn soil and watch his farm grow .
the 26-year-old lives in dandwal , a small village in gujarat , in india 's south .
somar wishes he could spend his whole year here but he ca n't grow enough to support the family .
when monsoon ends he works on other people 's farms making just 60 rupees – or one euro – a day .
as india pushes forward with its quest for development , small farmers like somar are getting left behind , according to vijaya pastala .
" gujarat is the fastest growing state but there are still many tribal villages that do n't have electricity .
not many finish school , not many go to college , women are married early .
a lot of them are loan-dependent , money-lender-dependent . "
a sustainable solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many tribal villages without electricity vijaya pastala is the ceo of under the mango tree -lrb- utmt -rrb- , a company that links organic small farms to a national market .
after witnessing tribal life in gujarat , vijaya was determined to help .
in march 2009 she launched the not-for-profit bees for poverty reduction program .
farmers buy a starter kit of two bright blue bee boxes at 2,500 rupees or 42 euros .
they then undergo an intensive training program , where they learn how to find , capture , box and care for the indigenous bee – apis cerena .
beekeeping in india is not like beekeeping in the west .
there is no protective suit , it 's just your bare skin up against thousands of potentially angry bees .
it takes patience , persistence and courage . " i 've been stung up to 100 times in a single day when boxing hives , " utmt 's bee expert atar singh said .
however , as jhula mahado found out , the pain pays off when you hit pay dirt for the first time .
for months , jhula has been carefully tending his hive .
every two days he checks the combs making sure that they are sheltered from the wind and rain .
each day he watched as swarms of black and gold entered the box carrying packs of pollen .
as atar opens the box to show , more than 45 thousands bees swarm around rich yellow combs , oozing with honey .
the combs are cut and the honey extracted .
jhula will make 16 euros from this batch .
he should be able to collect honey every 15 to 20 days for the next four months .
it 's a huge boost to his average annual income , which is less than 170 euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh honey makes up for numerous painful bee stings more than just honey according to atar , the rewards of beekeeping go even further .
" honey is just a by product or direct advantage to the beekeepers .
the indirect advantages are much more , even in terms of monetary benefits .
having bees helps to increase their agricultural productivity through pollination .
bees are responsible for 80 percent pollination for the crop , which increases about 35 to 40 percent of yield , " he explained .
more importantly , atar said , beekeeping is helping his favourite bee , apis cerena , make a long- needed comeback .
the cerena is an indigenous indian bee – famous for its small size and ability to crawl into delicate flowers .
but their population is dwindling due to loss of habitat and disease .
one of the worst health scares , atar explained , started in 1972 with the introduction of apis mellifera – a european bee .
" apis mellifera could actually produce 75 to 85 kilos of honey versus apis cerena which could only produce 5 to 7 kilos of honey .
but within six months a viral disease known as sad brood had been introduced and it caused a lot of harm to the indigenous bee population . "
the other threat has been india 's tradition of honey hunting .
searching for gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the population of india 's indigenous bee is dwindling somu sotru is a traditional honey hunter .
he goes into the forest , finds a hive , smokes it until the bees leave and then crushes it to get the honey .
" we go into the forest with an axe and cut the honey comb .
we squeeze the honey and throw the combs away .
we collect it into plastic bags and then sell it , " somu said .
somu has two bee boxes on his farm , but when atar opens them , the hives are empty and covered in white webs , created by wax moths .
somu lacks the patience required to care for bees , and still views honey hunting as a quick fix .
although some older farmers like somu remain unconvinced of the benefits of beekeeping , others like somar devji maghi have embraced the opportunity .
the program has trained 600 farmers , out of which 100 are master trainers like somar .
they help farmers catch , keep and care for the bees .
" now it 's just seven people who have taken up this activity .
i want more people to take up this activity , as well as the landless .
i want the activities to be so good that you take the name of our village everywhere you go , " somar said .
somar has already noticed an increase of productivity this year .
he has collected cucumbers every three days , compared to every six and hopes to have eight to ten bee boxes on his farm by the end of next year .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 23.12.2010 ' the president just would n't accept no for an answer ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas e. mann only days ago the signs were ominous that the us senate would reject the start arms reduction treaty , but as thomas e. mann tells dw , president barack obama stuck to his guns and has come away with an important victory . thomas e. mann is the w. averell harimann chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution .
he 's also a member of the council on foreign relations .
deutsche welle : the start treaty was passed with a majority of 71 votes - were you surprised ?
thomas mann : no , the last couple of days have seen a movement among republicans to support ratification of the treaty and it seemed likely that they would get at least 70 and possibly higher .
it was n't the kind of near unanimous vote that we 're used to having on arms control treaties .
but given the extraordinary effort by the no. 1 and 2 republican leaders in the senate against ratification i think it 's a significant achievement . for a long time it looked as if the obama administration would not get the majority of the votes .
what was the tipping point ?
the administration had been working for months with senator jon kyl who was sort of the policy leader on this front … it had been negotiating with him with the expectation that reasonable compromises addressing concerns such as freedom to move ahead on missile defense and modernizing our nuclear weapons … that the republicans would fall in line , but as we got closer to the end of the 111th congress it became increasingly apparent that kyl was going to do everything in his power to prevent any action from occurring and pushing it into the next congress where prospects would diminish given the nature of the new members coming and those leaving .
at that point the administration started working seriously working with other republicans who would more naturally respond to the strong support for its ratification among very prominent former republican national security officials .
contrary to what the republicans argue , the treaty was not rushed through .
no , there were a large number of hearings conducted , there were ample opportunities for additional debate and consideration .
my own view is that for most of the senators reluctant to play ball it was more a desire to deny the president a victory than it was serious concerns about the substance of the treaty .
so it was not about substance but about political wrangling ?
that is right .
they argued it on substance , but each of the issues raised were answered and with impressive arguments and evidence … there was n't in the end a serious substantive argument against it .
and that 's why some of the senators like john mccain and lindsey graham ended up looking petulant .
it was embarrassing that senator lindsey graham was complaining about the productivity of a lame duck session , that so many things were accomplished that president obama was not further wounded but was strengthened .
have you ever seen this kind of wrangling during the last days of a congress before ?
yes i have - the ending of a legislative session is oftentimes a mess especially in the senate .
it 's a very partisan era of american politics , parties are deeply polarized , and engaged in partisan war to an extent we have n't seen over a century .
but was what is striking is how productive the 111th congress has been … the initial and the second stimulus , health care reform , financial regulation and a series of other domestic policy achievements , managing to get the defense authorization bill passed , the do n't ask do n't tell policy repealed and the new start treaty ratified is quite an achievement .
so for those who see nothing but dysfunction in our politics it 's important to realize that the combination and party polarization and senate filibusters makes it very difficult for a majority to achieve its objectives .
and certainly a number of items like climate change legislation and immigration were not achieved and nonetheless inspite of all of that and the perfectly dreadful way the process appears to the public , i think that the president and the democrats can be pleased that they have ended a very productive congress .
you mentioned president obama - how important is this ratification for him , after all , he invested a lot in supporting this treaty ?
i think it 's important .
this is one in which he really stuck to his guns .
he just would n't accept no for an answer .
he said it was critically important to american national security .
our standing in the world , our relations with russia , and our policies and efforts with iran and north korea , he really raised the stakes for himself in pushing ahead with this - it has to be a boost to him , certainly countries around the world will look upon this as a major achievement and feel a bit more comfortable working with the president .
is the start treaty more of a symbolic act ?
how important is it really for the us-russian relations and for nuclear proliferation ?
it 's not a dramatically ambitious agreement , but it needed to be passed , if only to maintain inspection regimes , it 's mainly to keep relations and negotiations with the russians alive and to maintain credibility in the world for trying to deal with problems of nuclear proliferation .
it 's not that the achievement itself was substantively historic , but it 's agreement and ratification are very important for the broader security agenda .
does this turn the year around for him ?
it certainly means that the setback from the midterm election which is real but is largely driven by the economic conditions in this country that that setback is in no way going to paralyze him for months or a full year .
he can take a punch , he 's absorbed the loss but he 's pushing ahead .
he 'll find congress much more difficult to work with with the republican majority in the house and a diminished democratic majority in the senate .
he 'll be playing defense as far as some of his achievements in the 111th congress -lsb- are concerned -rsb- .
he 'll almost certainly be turning to areas where he has the authority to act alone as the chief executive and head of the administrative process of government .
i think it 's also the case in getting some additional stimulus out of congress and we 'll likely see some economic growth and a decline of the unemployment rate over the next year or so as we lead up to the presidential election year and that will certainly strengthen his position going into reelection .

after a lengthy legal battle , a dutch brewery is getting to keep its name . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled on wednesday that the dutch brewery bavaria nv can continue to use its company name trademark .
the bavarian brewers federation had tried to prevent the firm from using the " bavaria " label under the eu 's protected designation of origin -lrb- pdo -rrb- system , which allows only food or drink producers from the territory in question to use the name .
the ecj in luxembourg judged that bavarian beer was only protected by eu rules from 2001 , when bavarian beer was recognized under the pdo system .
the dutch company 's 1995 trademark therefore took priority .
bavaria nv described itself as " delighted with the ruling " in a statement .
" this implies that bavaria can still sell -lsb- its -rsb- beer in germany . "
first come , first served the company used the label " bavaria " as early as 1925 and registered the trademark in germany in april 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like bayern munich coach luis van gaal appreciate bavarian beer the bavarian brewers federation submitted an application to the german government to get eu protection for its beers in 1993 .
the application was passed on to the eu in 1994 , and bavarian beer was finally registered by the european commission in 2001 .
the brewers association went to a higher regional court in munich , asking that bavaria nv renounce their 1995 trademark .
the dutch company appealed to the german federal court of justice , which referred the decision to the european union 's highest court in 2008 .
the pdo system allows territories to register the name of a food or drink produced in , and named after , a territory .
only producers working in the region can then use the name .
cheeses are the most common type of product listed .
" feta " cheese belongs to specific parts of greece , while the ecj ruled in 2008 that " parmesan " must come from italy .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

but berlin denies that the plan is official policy . germany is considering a " european stability , growth and investment fund , " according to a government paper seen by the sueddeutsche zeitung daily .
the newspaper said that french finance minister christine lagarde had called for the 16 eurozone countries to build a strong economic alliance that would explicitly exclude britain .
lagarde told the newspaper that london should not be allowed to " hold everyone else up . "
she also said this " economic government " would have to be consulted if any member state takes a decision that affects the others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde said london should not be allowed to stand in the way the mooted body would exist side-by-side with the european central bank , would benefit from the same independence and be tasked with helping distressed eurozone countries if they meet a list of strict conditions .
governments that need to borrow from the fund would have to put up solid collateral such as gold reserves or private bonds , the newspaper said .
the document said such a fund would have an " unlimited capacity for refinancing " and would be proposed to finance ministers in mid-january .
denials the german finance ministry moved quickly to deny the report .
" the document mentioned in -lsb- thursday 's -rsb- sueddeutsche zeitung comes from considerations made at the working level of the -lsb- german finance ministry -rsb- , " a statement said .
the ministry 's leadership has apparently not seen or approved the document , and it does not represent the ministry 's position .
" this is not the path we 're following , " the statement said .
permanent financial security in addition to germany , finland , france , ireland and the netherlands are working on various proposals .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is to discuss the plans with his french counterpart lagarde on thursday in strasbourg , the report said .

some wonder if the harsh winters are caused by climate change , while others ponder ways to deal with it . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .
we better get used to harsh winters ... climate change ! - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

" potsdam 's city council has organized a program of around 130 events including exhibitions and open-air film screenings to celebrate the birthday of the world 's oldest large-scale film production center . venues preparing special events include the konfrad wolf school of film and tv , the babelsberg filmpark and the potsdam film museum .
the event series , entitled " die traumfabrik – 100 jahre film in babelsberg " -lrb- " the dream factory – 100 years of film at babelsberg " -rrb- focuses on film production throughout five distinct eras of german history .
the company biscop built its first glass studio on the babelsberg lot in 1911 and today is not only the largest film production complex in germany but also the oldest in the world .
work on the first movie produced there , " der totentanz " -lrb- " the dance of the dead , " -rrb- began on february 12 , 1912 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iconic production : fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece " metropolis " putting babelsberg on the map arguably the most iconic production ever mounted at babelsberg was fritz lang 's silent science-fiction masterpiece " metropolis " which was filmed in an enormous , specially constructed studio in 1925 .
today , this vast studio has been divided into three smaller units and renamed the marlene dietrich hall .
so important was " metropolis " for the studio that the iconic image of maria , the evil robot , is still used to this day as the studio 's official logo .
the first stage equipped for sound film production , the " tonkreuz , " was built in 1929 for production of the first ever german sound film , " melodie des herzens " -lrb- " melody of the heart " -rrb- but it was the next sound film which really caught the public 's attention and catapulted a young marlene dietrich to stardom : " der blaue engel " -lrb- " the blue angel . " -rrb-
a century of turmoil studio babelsberg remained prolific during the nazi-era with around 1000 films produced there between 1933 and 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman polanski has worked at babelsberg twice after world war ii , the studios came under control of the state-owned film production company of east germany , defa , and up until the regime collapsed in 1990 , some 800 feature films and 600 television films were produced there .
to this day , babelsberg remains a popular choice for international productions and recent years have seen a number of a-list hollywood films shot there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 23.12.2010 spanish builder acs plays divide and conquer at hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders say workers ' worst fears have been removed hochtief 's works council is angry that german builders ' union ig bau has dropped its opposition to a takeover bid from spanish company acs .
the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

but a couple of obstacles still have to be cleared before it can come into force . russian leaders on thursday welcomed the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- by the united states senate , with top lawmakers saying the ratification process could start before the end of the week .
the news agency interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying the new start " will not only further russian and us security , but it will have a positive effect on international security and stability . "
a spokeswoman for president dmitry medvedev said he welcomed the ratification " with satisfaction " and " expressed hope that the duma and federation council are ready to examine this question and ratify the document . "
under the accord , russia and the united states pledge to cut their stockpile of active nuclear warheads to 1,550 within seven years , or about 30 percent from when the first start , signed in 1991 , expired a year ago .
both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the duma may approve the new start this week medvedev and us president barack obama signed the new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .
russian ratification near the us senate on wednesday voted 71-26 to ratify the treaty , giving obama a major foreign policy victory before the current senate adjourns and his democrats lose several seats to newly-elected republicans in january .
democratic leaders in the senate allowed some non-binding amendments to the original document to secure more republican support .
these included a recommitment to deploying a missile defense system , modernization of the current nuclear arsenal and seeking new talks with russia on limiting tactical nuclear weapons .
while there is some opposition to the treaty among opposition parties in the duma , medvedev 's united russia party enjoys a strong majority and the body was widely expected to approve it .
but konstantin kosachev , chairman of the duma 's foreign affairs committee , said russian lawmakers would need to study and respond to the amendments made by their american counterparts before giving their final approval .
the treaty 's first reading and debate in the duma was scheduled for december 24 .
" further work on the ratification bill will continue once the duma resumes its work in january , " news agencies quoted kosachev as saying .

but a couple of obstacles still have to be cleared before it can come into force . russian leaders on thursday welcomed the ratification of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- by the united states senate , with top lawmakers saying the ratification process could start before the end of the week .
the news agency interfax quoted russian foreign minister sergei lavrov as saying the new start " will not only further russian and us security , but it will have a positive effect on international security and stability . "
a spokeswoman for president dmitry medvedev said he welcomed the ratification " with satisfaction " and " expressed hope that the duma and federation council are ready to examine this question and ratify the document . "
under the accord , russia and the united states pledge to cut their stockpile of active nuclear warheads to 1,550 within seven years , or about 30 percent from when the first start , signed in 1991 , expired a year ago .
both countries would have the right to inspect the other 's progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the duma may approve the new start this week medvedev and us president barack obama signed the new start in april after a year of negotiations between diplomats from the two countries .
russian ratification near the us senate on wednesday voted 71-26 to ratify the treaty , giving obama a major foreign policy victory before the current senate adjourns and his democrats lose several seats to newly-elected republicans in january .
democratic leaders in the senate allowed some non-binding amendments to the original document to secure more republican support .
these included a recommitment to deploying a missile defense system , modernization of the current nuclear arsenal and seeking new talks with russia on limiting tactical nuclear weapons .
while there is some opposition to the treaty among opposition parties in the duma , medvedev 's united russia party enjoys a strong majority and the body was widely expected to approve it .
but konstantin kosachev , chairman of the duma 's foreign affairs committee , said russian lawmakers would need to study and respond to the amendments made by their american counterparts before giving their final approval .
the treaty 's first reading and debate in the duma was scheduled for december 24 .
" further work on the ratification bill will continue once the duma resumes its work in january , " news agencies quoted kosachev as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 23.12.2010 spanish builder acs plays divide and conquer at hochtief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders say workers ' worst fears have been removed hochtief 's works council is angry that german builders ' union ig bau has dropped its opposition to a takeover bid from spanish company acs .
the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.12.2010 the sack race : dw assesses the job security of the bundesliga 's coaches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " haunted coach " look , once worn by soldo in cologne as the bundesliga takes a well-earned breather , deutsche welle looks at the situation surrounding the current bundesliga coaches and where they stand in the potential unemployment stakes . we 've already seen cologne dismiss zvonimir soldo this season and stuttgart have fired not one but two coaches since august with christian gross and jens keller paying for the club 's horrid form .
here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .
uncertain future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf : " if i leave now i can still catch my flight " what 's that by the door , thomas schaaf ?
is that a suitcase we see ?
it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .
given the time to hone this team , jupp could be the man to end the jinx that hangs over the bayarena .
we 've all heard about the village team plucked from obscurity by a visionary owner with billions of euros to back up his dreams , but little is ever said about ralf rangnick , the man who gets the hoffenheim players to perform .
the glitter is fading from their story these days only because people now expect them to do well .
they are established bundesliga class .
money may have brought the players to the club but rangnick has them playing like a team .

it 's hard to believe that the coach who has steered werder bremen to four cup wins and one championship title in nearly 11 years of service is being spoken of as a potential casualty but bremen 's downward trajectory this season is just the latest trip in a slow fall from grace .
if werder are to recover , a change may have to be made … perhaps not now but in the near future .
a treble-winning coach should have the necessary capital to withstand an ordinary season .
at most clubs , this could be true but louis van gaal must know by now that bayern munich are not just any club .
there have already been mutterings from the all-powerful munich hierarchy about van gaal 's style and with the league campaign not going to plan , it could be suggested that bayern are falling out of love with the gruff dutchman .
if he delivers the champions league this year , expect to see him in charge next season .
if not … felix magath has had a stay of execution at schalke .
the abominable start the gelsenkirchen club had put the former bayern and wolfsburg coach 's rather rotund head on a block but in recent weeks , the royal blues have crept to safety and secured a place in the champions league knock-out round .
magath was always going to be too expensive to fire anyway … armin veh must be wondering what he has got himself into at hamburg .
one of germany 's biggest clubs , he has discovered that these days , hsv 's standing is based on past glories and reputations alone .
still , hsv could be a lot worse off and a second half surge in the spring months could see them heading towards europe .
veh will have at least until the summer to wonder what the hell is going on with hamburg .
state of limbo there are a number of clubs which never expect too much from their coaches .
as long as they do n't get relegated and try to get as close to the europa league positions as possible , then they can pretty much expect to keep their names on their office doors .
this can be said for michael skibbe at frankfurt , marco kurz at kaiserslautern and dieter hecking at nuremberg .
even holger stanislawski at st. pauli can be relatively sure of staying in charge even if the hamburg club go down .
dead men walking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck : " if i blind myself then i do n't have to watch " being the worst team in the league during a season in which cologne and stuttgart have made such concerted efforts to claim that title is no mean feat but michael frontzeck has achieved this with borussia moenchengladbach .
if gladbach were a race horse , we 'd be talking about them in the past tense with the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air .
the misery will only be over for the team in may .
for frontzeck , the sweet release is likely to come a lot sooner .
frank schaefer is praying for more snow to fall on cologne so he can later claim that the adverse winter conditions contributed to him staying home after the restart .
the real reason may turn out to be that his employers just did n't want him back .
cologne are not only in a relegation dogfight but they are showing the uninspiring form of a team that does n't care .
schaefer looks incapable of rallying his charges and getting the necessary results out of them .
there 's a reason christoph daum 's number remains on speed dial at the rheinenergie stadium .
if ever there was a poisoned chalice in this year 's bundesliga then it 's the one which is now being pressed to bruno labbadia 's lips at stuttgart .
a club which has contributed two thirds of this season 's sackings to date , labbadia must be wondering when the receptacle he 's holding will be tipped .
he should savor the moment though - it 's likely to be the only cup he gets his hands on this season .
with vfb stuck in a self-destructive cycle , who knows whether the stuttgart hierarchy will stop at just three coaches this year in their search for one who can guide them to safety .
a man who is no stranger to ignominious exits , steve mcclaren will be hoping that the weather will clear soon so he can get out of wolfsburg as fast as possible when the powers at volkswagen call time on his short tenure .
this week 's exit to energie cottbus in the german cup caps a miserable run of form for the first english coach to work in the bundesliga .
his experience may lead to him being the last for some time .

here is deutsche welle 's assessment of how things look for those coaches still gainfully employed .
safe as houses the hugely likeable-slash-massively annoying at times juergen klopp must be the safest coach in the bundesliga this season .
he 's taken his borussia dortmund side to the top of the league and has kept them there with only two league defeats to speak of in the first half of the season .
even if they blow the championship after the restart , klopp will remain a hero .
if awards for overachievement were handed out in the bundesliga , there would be a number of hands grabbing for the gong but mirko slomka at hanover probably deserves it more than any other .
hanover were already marked for relegation before the season began , with a team that looked ordinary at best .
slomka has taken them into the champions league places and has even survived a dip in form to keep pace with the top clubs .
the man 's done good .
robin dutt is one of those few coaches who can operate with a lot less pressure than others .
coaching freiburg rarely comes with the same amount of expectation afforded the coach at one of the big clubs , so as long as freiburg stay in the league , he and his employers will be satisfied .
but for freiburg to still be flying high in the top half of the table at christmas is a testament to this young coach 's talents .
if he and freiburg do part company in the future , it will be because bigger jobs have become available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel strikes the pose that adorned the early sports pages the toothy roar and nostalgic stubble of thomas tuchel adorned more sports pages at the start of the season than all the other coaches put together .
his expression of delight -lrb- rivalled only , perhaps , by felix magath 's haunted look -rrb- encapsulated the first two months of the campaign as mainz led the way .
they may have gone off the boil but tuchel has already done more than his employers could 've hoped for .
he and his team deserve champions league soccer next season , at the very least .
jupp heynckes knows the bundesliga inside out so it 's no surprise that he has found a club that will allow him to build towards future success without the pressure of instant glory .
bayer leverkusen nearly gave him a dream season last year but faded towards the end .
this time , they 're keeping pace and playing some lovely stuff at the same time .

he 's also a member of the council on foreign relations .
deutsche welle : the start treaty was passed with a majority of 71 votes - were you surprised ?
thomas mann : no , the last couple of days have seen a movement among republicans to support ratification of the treaty and it seemed likely that they would get at least 70 and possibly higher .
it was n't the kind of near unanimous vote that we 're used to having on arms control treaties .
but given the extraordinary effort by the no. 1 and 2 republican leaders in the senate against ratification i think it 's a significant achievement . for a long time it looked as if the obama administration would not get the majority of the votes .
what was the tipping point ?
the administration had been working for months with senator jon kyl who was sort of the policy leader on this front … it had been negotiating with him with the expectation that reasonable compromises addressing concerns such as freedom to move ahead on missile defense and modernizing our nuclear weapons … that the republicans would fall in line , but as we got closer to the end of the 111th congress it became increasingly apparent that kyl was going to do everything in his power to prevent any action from occurring and pushing it into the next congress where prospects would diminish given the nature of the new members coming and those leaving .
at that point the administration started working seriously working with other republicans who would more naturally respond to the strong support for its ratification among very prominent former republican national security officials .
contrary to what the republicans argue , the treaty was not rushed through .
no , there were a large number of hearings conducted , there were ample opportunities for additional debate and consideration .
my own view is that for most of the senators reluctant to play ball it was more a desire to deny the president a victory than it was serious concerns about the substance of the treaty .
so it was not about substance but about political wrangling ?
that is right .
they argued it on substance , but each of the issues raised were answered and with impressive arguments and evidence … there was n't in the end a serious substantive argument against it .
and that 's why some of the senators like john mccain and lindsey graham ended up looking petulant .
it was embarrassing that senator lindsey graham was complaining about the productivity of a lame duck session , that so many things were accomplished that president obama was not further wounded but was strengthened .
have you ever seen this kind of wrangling during the last days of a congress before ?
yes i have - the ending of a legislative session is oftentimes a mess especially in the senate .
it 's a very partisan era of american politics , parties are deeply polarized , and engaged in partisan war to an extent we have n't seen over a century .
but was what is striking is how productive the 111th congress has been … the initial and the second stimulus , health care reform , financial regulation and a series of other domestic policy achievements , managing to get the defense authorization bill passed , the do n't ask do n't tell policy repealed and the new start treaty ratified is quite an achievement .
so for those who see nothing but dysfunction in our politics it 's important to realize that the combination and party polarization and senate filibusters makes it very difficult for a majority to achieve its objectives .
and certainly a number of items like climate change legislation and immigration were not achieved and nonetheless inspite of all of that and the perfectly dreadful way the process appears to the public , i think that the president and the democrats can be pleased that they have ended a very productive congress .
you mentioned president obama - how important is this ratification for him , after all , he invested a lot in supporting this treaty ?
i think it 's important .
this is one in which he really stuck to his guns .
he just would n't accept no for an answer .
he said it was critically important to american national security .
our standing in the world , our relations with russia , and our policies and efforts with iran and north korea , he really raised the stakes for himself in pushing ahead with this - it has to be a boost to him , certainly countries around the world will look upon this as a major achievement and feel a bit more comfortable working with the president .
is the start treaty more of a symbolic act ?
how important is it really for the us-russian relations and for nuclear proliferation ?
it 's not a dramatically ambitious agreement , but it needed to be passed , if only to maintain inspection regimes , it 's mainly to keep relations and negotiations with the russians alive and to maintain credibility in the world for trying to deal with problems of nuclear proliferation .
it 's not that the achievement itself was substantively historic , but it 's agreement and ratification are very important for the broader security agenda .
does this turn the year around for him ?
it certainly means that the setback from the midterm election which is real but is largely driven by the economic conditions in this country that that setback is in no way going to paralyze him for months or a full year .
he can take a punch , he 's absorbed the loss but he 's pushing ahead .
he 'll find congress much more difficult to work with with the republican majority in the house and a diminished democratic majority in the senate .
he 'll be playing defense as far as some of his achievements in the 111th congress -lsb- are concerned -rsb- .
he 'll almost certainly be turning to areas where he has the authority to act alone as the chief executive and head of the administrative process of government .
i think it 's also the case in getting some additional stimulus out of congress and we 'll likely see some economic growth and a decline of the unemployment rate over the next year or so as we lead up to the presidential election year and that will certainly strengthen his position going into reelection .

it certainly means that the setback from the midterm election which is real but is largely driven by the economic conditions in this country that that setback is in no way going to paralyze him for months or a full year .
he can take a punch , he 's absorbed the loss but he 's pushing ahead .
he 'll find congress much more difficult to work with with the republican majority in the house and a diminished democratic majority in the senate .
he 'll be playing defense as far as some of his achievements in the 111th congress -lsb- are concerned -rsb- .
he 'll almost certainly be turning to areas where he has the authority to act alone as the chief executive and head of the administrative process of government .
i think it 's also the case in getting some additional stimulus out of congress and we 'll likely see some economic growth and a decline of the unemployment rate over the next year or so as we lead up to the presidential election year and that will certainly strengthen his position going into reelection .

the vote was accompanied by strikes and protests due to wage cuts and tax hikes . greek lawmakers approved a tough austerity budget early on thursday to comply with the demands imposed as part of an international bailout to the debt-ridden country .
the new budget for 2011 was debated for five days before being adopted by 156 votes to 142 .
the ruling socialist party backed the measures in the face of opposition from the right and left .
some 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.9 billion -rrb- will be cut from the government budget in an attempt to reduce greece 's deficit from 15.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 7.4 percent .
this follows austerity measures introduced earlier this year .
greek prime minister george papandreou said that the country was in the grip of a " deep crisis , " and urged the opposition to join with his party in the " race " to save the nation for future generations .
" i am more determined than ever to change greece , " papandreou said .
" we will not go bankrupt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou narrowly got his spending cuts through parliament conservative opposition leader antonis samaras argued that austerity - and taxes - were crippling the greek economy .
" the way out of this crisis lies in growth , " said samaras .
some 3,000 union members and communists staged separate demonstrations on wednesday to call for the budget to be rejected .
bus and subway drivers in athens staged their fourth strike this month against wage cuts .
the cuts are one aspect of the austerity measures that greece put in place as a condition for receiving a 110-billion-euro bailout from the imf and eu .

but within six months a viral disease known as sad brood had been introduced and it caused a lot of harm to the indigenous bee population . "
the other threat has been india 's tradition of honey hunting .

" we go into the forest with an axe and cut the honey comb .
we squeeze the honey and throw the combs away .

somu has two bee boxes on his farm , but when atar opens them , the hives are empty and covered in white webs , created by wax moths .
somu lacks the patience required to care for bees , and still views honey hunting as a quick fix .
although some older farmers like somu remain unconvinced of the benefits of beekeeping , others like somar devji maghi have embraced the opportunity .
the program has trained 600 farmers , out of which 100 are master trainers like somar .
they help farmers catch , keep and care for the bees .
" now it 's just seven people who have taken up this activity .
i want more people to take up this activity , as well as the landless .
i want the activities to be so good that you take the name of our village everywhere you go , " somar said .
somar has already noticed an increase of productivity this year .
he has collected cucumbers every three days , compared to every six and hopes to have eight to ten bee boxes on his farm by the end of next year .

now an ngo is trying to increase farm income through beekeeping , while saving threatened local bee populations at the same time . monsoon is somar devji maghi 's favourite time of year .
an iridescent green has swept across the ground and for the next four months , somar will plant , turn soil and watch his farm grow .
the 26-year-old lives in dandwal , a small village in gujarat , in india 's south .
somar wishes he could spend his whole year here but he ca n't grow enough to support the family .
when monsoon ends he works on other people 's farms making just 60 rupees – or one euro – a day .
as india pushes forward with its quest for development , small farmers like somar are getting left behind , according to vijaya pastala .
" gujarat is the fastest growing state but there are still many tribal villages that do n't have electricity .
not many finish school , not many go to college , women are married early .
a lot of them are loan-dependent , money-lender-dependent . "
a sustainable solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still many tribal villages without electricity vijaya pastala is the ceo of under the mango tree -lrb- utmt -rrb- , a company that links organic small farms to a national market .
after witnessing tribal life in gujarat , vijaya was determined to help .
in march 2009 she launched the not-for-profit bees for poverty reduction program .
farmers buy a starter kit of two bright blue bee boxes at 2,500 rupees or 42 euros .
they then undergo an intensive training program , where they learn how to find , capture , box and care for the indigenous bee – apis cerena .
beekeeping in india is not like beekeeping in the west .
there is no protective suit , it 's just your bare skin up against thousands of potentially angry bees .
it takes patience , persistence and courage . " i 've been stung up to 100 times in a single day when boxing hives , " utmt 's bee expert atar singh said .
however , as jhula mahado found out , the pain pays off when you hit pay dirt for the first time .
for months , jhula has been carefully tending his hive .
every two days he checks the combs making sure that they are sheltered from the wind and rain .
each day he watched as swarms of black and gold entered the box carrying packs of pollen .
as atar opens the box to show , more than 45 thousands bees swarm around rich yellow combs , oozing with honey .
the combs are cut and the honey extracted .
jhula will make 16 euros from this batch .
he should be able to collect honey every 15 to 20 days for the next four months .
it 's a huge boost to his average annual income , which is less than 170 euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fresh honey makes up for numerous painful bee stings more than just honey according to atar , the rewards of beekeeping go even further .
" honey is just a by product or direct advantage to the beekeepers .
the indirect advantages are much more , even in terms of monetary benefits .
having bees helps to increase their agricultural productivity through pollination .
bees are responsible for 80 percent pollination for the crop , which increases about 35 to 40 percent of yield , " he explained .
more importantly , atar said , beekeeping is helping his favourite bee , apis cerena , make a long- needed comeback .
the cerena is an indigenous indian bee – famous for its small size and ability to crawl into delicate flowers .
but their population is dwindling due to loss of habitat and disease .
one of the worst health scares , atar explained , started in 1972 with the introduction of apis mellifera – a european bee .
" apis mellifera could actually produce 75 to 85 kilos of honey versus apis cerena which could only produce 5 to 7 kilos of honey .
but within six months a viral disease known as sad brood had been introduced and it caused a lot of harm to the indigenous bee population . "

this follows austerity measures introduced earlier this year .
greek prime minister george papandreou said that the country was in the grip of a " deep crisis , " and urged the opposition to join with his party in the " race " to save the nation for future generations .
" i am more determined than ever to change greece , " papandreou said .
" we will not go bankrupt . "

bus and subway drivers in athens staged their fourth strike this month against wage cuts .
the cuts are one aspect of the austerity measures that greece put in place as a condition for receiving a 110-billion-euro bailout from the imf and eu .

some wonder if the harsh winters are caused by climate change , while others ponder ways to deal with it . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

freezing weather makes travel in europe a gamble hello from canada , where a lot of us are scratching our heads and wondering what all the fuss in europe is about .
this is normal late autumn / winter weather for most of us , and things carry on pretty much as they do when there 's no snow .
our airports are rarely closed due to snow , it 's mostly fog that grounds flights .
in any event , good luck over there ! - jennifer , canada are the severe unusually long winters which we are now having at unusual shocking low temperatures due to the volcano eruption ?
the snow seems to be a different unusual texture , almost dry .
salt seems to have no effect on this , which is making it unable to melt .
and it has caused traffic to come to a standstill .
the seasons have totally changed , and weather is no longer anything what we 're used to .
a lot of people are getting " chest infections " to which antibiotics are having no effect , even after their third course of treatment .
is this the start of the effects to come due to volcanic ash ?
has the drastic change of weather link to the volcanic eruption been investigated ? - moha , ireland having grown up in new york , in the catskill mountains , i learned to drive in ice and snow at age 15 with my learners permit .
in the northeastern united states , people who grow up in the cold , ice and snowy winters are used to the bad weather .
the problem arises when people who are either not native to the climate , or have never learned to drive in these conditions , get on the roads behind the wheel of a car and cause accidents .
when there is dangerous snow with icy conditions , you need to take extra precautions , and it usually means driving slower , taking alternate transportation -lrb- train , bus -rrb- or walking where you can .
you can drive in the snow if you know how to control the vehicle ; you have traction on ice and snow , just not as much as on dry surfaces .
as for worrying about the weather , those who are not prepared tend to be the ones in trouble .
in your car keep a blanket or sleeping bag , some dried food , a flashlight with extra battery , chemical hand warmer packs .
being prepared for the worst is better than no preparation at all . - heir , us improved travel conditions give relief to snow-struck germany have your holiday travel plans been affected by the snow ?
so brussels wants to add another layer of bureaucracy .
that will most certainly be a big help !
instead , why not talk to canadians , for example , who have a lot more experience with snowed-under airports .
always trying to re-invent the wheel when it is already invented .
we better get used to harsh winters ... climate change ! - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .

the union says it secured workers a good deal as acs closes in on its target . spanish construction giant actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- appears to be succeeding in its plan to acquire german rival hochtief as its stake in the company creeps towards the 30-percent mark .
acs announced on thursday it owned 27.72 percent of the voting rights in germany 's biggest builder , not including the 2.5 percent it is due to obtain from southeastern asset management .
under german regulations , a 30 percent stake gives acs the right to buy shares in the market without renewing its bid and without making further disclosures on its holding in hochtief as it tries to build a controlling stake of more than 50 percent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the acs bid say 11,000 german jobs are at risk the spanish concern has been stalking hochtief since september and made an official takeover bid at the beginning of december .
hochtief categorically rejected the bid , saying it did not make sense from either a financial or strategic standpoint .
acs countered this by raising its share-swap offer to exchange nine acs shares for every five hochtief shares .
its previous bid offered a ratio of eight to five .
the improved offer seems to have paid off .
by wednesday evening , acs swap-offer had gained it almost 360,000 shares in hochtief .
workers ' blessing another potential obstacle to the takeover was removed on wednesday , when acs and trade union ig bau made a surprise announcement .
union representatives have agreed to remove their objections to the takeover in exchange for assurances that there would be no redundancies as a result of restructuring .
the deal is guaranteed until 2013 .
" this means the biggest worry for hochtief employees is off the table , " ig bau chairman klaus wiesehuegel said .
" the takeover will not happen on the backs of hochtief workers . "
the trade union 's agreement has provoked an angry response from hochtief 's managers and company labor representatives .
" i am completely dismayed and amazed by the actions of the union , " complained siegfried mueller , chairman of the hochtief group works council , who claims he was unaware of the talks .
" this was not agreed , " he told german newspaper die welt , adding that the deal was not worth the paper it was written on without his consent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig bau says its talks have secured an excellent deal bruised egos wiesehuegel was unrepentant , saying ig bau had had no intention of angering hochtief 's management or works council .
" the agreement is exclusively about securing employees ' rights , should acs 's takeover bid be successful , " he said , adding that ig bau was perfectly within its rights to enter negotiations on its own .
" we 're surprised that mueller only sees this agreement negatively , " ruprecht hammerschmidt , spokesman for ig bau told deutsche welle .
" if he did n't know about the negotiations , why did he get so worked up when we announced we were going to talk to acs on december 1 ? "
" why is he blocking everything ?
what is the alternative ?
our agreement secures the jobs and the location in germany , " hammerschmidt said .
the spokesman also denied that the agreement makes the takeover more likely .
" the question of whether it goes through or not is no longer down to the approval of the trade unions .
the decision is up to the shareholders and the shareholders alone . "
acs dismissed objections to the agreement .
" hurt vanities do n't help the workers , " an unnamed acs source told die welt newspaper .
hochtief chairman herbert luetkestratkoetter has warned a takeover by acs could have serious consequences for germany .
the spanish company has debts worth around nine billion euros , which could have a negative impact on the relatively stable hochtief , which employs 11,000 people across the nation .
