the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

sauerland , who has been under pressure to resign over the city 's organization of the event , said in a statement monday that he " will face up to his responsibilities - both personal and political . "
no-confidence vote several parties as well as the people of duisburg have been calling for his resignation .

but if sauerland , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , gets enough support from his fellow party members , he could stave off the vote of no-confidence .
looking for answers in the meantime , sauerland has launched an inquiry into the handling of the love parade festival , in which 21 people where killed on july 24 , and over 500 injured .
on monday , five people were still being treated in hospital .
the dead were crushed as they were led into an overcrowded access tunnel to the techno music festival .
around 1,000 duisburg residents have signed a petition demanding sauerland 's resignation .
the left party and the social democratic groups in the duisburg city council have also called for him to step down .
german president christian wulff said he should accept political responsibility , and pointed out that this did not mean he would be admitting personal guilt over the deaths . an interim police report last wednesday put the blame on organizers , listing a catalog of catastrophic mistakes in managing a crowd of hundreds of thousands on a site that was not suitable for that many people .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .
" the average worker is going to see a marked improvement in negotiating power , " iza director hilmar schneider told the welt am sonntag newspaper .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .

" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .

" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .

" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

" we have unanimously decided that i shall leave my post today , " the bearded rebel fighter said in a video posted on youtube monday .
the new leader of the islamist group " caucasus emirate " will be aslambek vadalov , described by umarov as " younger and more energetic . "
vadalov and one other man , known only as " mustafa " , appeared alongside umarov , sitting relaxed in a forest in the video message .
in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.08.2010 coalition cracks appear over pensions as poll ratings slide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support for chancellor merkel 's coalition is sliding rifts are once again appearing in angela merkel ’ s coalition as polls show the government ’ s popularity sinking fast .
the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

dw-world.de opposition party pledges to fight nuclear power extension the green party says it wo n't let the government extend the lives of nuclear power plants without a fight .
opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union .
-lrb- 26.07.2010 -rrb- merkel papers over coalition cracks with summery words chancellor angela merkel gave a cheerful performance at her traditional pre-holiday press conference on wednesday , despite facing questions about awful opinîon polls , fleeing state premiers and her fractious coalition .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 02.08.2010 mexico hails drug lord coronel 's death but democracy remains at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coronel 's death may actually cause more violence not end it the killing of one of mexico 's most wanted drug cartel leaders last week is being heralded as one of the most significant victories in the on-going war against increasingly violent and militarized narcotics gangs . ignacio " nacho " coronel villareal , one of the leaders of the sinaloa cartel which is run by joachim guzman - mexico 's most wanted criminal , was killed in a shootout when troops raided his house in guadalajara on july 30 in an operation which also led to the arrest of one of his top lieutenants , iran francisco quinonez gastelum . government officials have hailed the killing as the most spectacular blow against drug traffickers yet for mexican president felipe calderon , who has been struggling to make an impact on the sinaloa cartel 's methamphetamine traffic to north america and europe or stem the violence which has claimed around 5,000 lives already this year . but while coronel 's death removes one of mexico 's drug kingpins from the picture and provides calderon with some welcome breathing space , some experts remain cautious . the lucrative nature of the drug business means that when one leader is removed , there are always many other traffickers ready to take their place so coronel 's death maybe nothing more than symbolic in the on-going battle against the cartels .
also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .
the feared the financial wrath of saudi arabia and kuwait if they did n't . " read more about iraq 's invasion of kuwait 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .

pitched battles have been fought in several parts of the state . on the bloodiest day in the kashmir valley for months angry crowds on sunday torched government offices , police camps and vehicles in south kashmir , after blocking the strategic jammu-srinagar highway by felling trees and erecting stone barricades .
on monday , protesters once again defied curfew in several places in the valley .
security forces resorted to firing live ammunition and teargas to control the swelling protests , in which women and children also took part .

go back ! " and " we want freedom ! " .
there were reports of some mosques being used to exhort people to come out onto the streets to protest . many see this present spell of violence as reminiscent of the late 1980s , when protests against new delhi 's rule sparked an armed conflict . the protesters , who are an assorted lot of taxi drivers , store clerks and college students , are determined to carry on their struggle and are now specifically targeting the state police .
" i think they have now realized what freedom is , " said tauseef ahmad , a college student who has been at the forefront of the protests in tangmarg , 35 kms from srinagar , the summer capital .
" for the past decade , they had no vision of what freedom is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money .

" technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

pitched battles have been fought in several parts of the state . on the bloodiest day in the kashmir valley for months angry crowds on sunday torched government offices , police camps and vehicles in south kashmir , after blocking the strategic jammu-srinagar highway by felling trees and erecting stone barricades .
on monday , protesters once again defied curfew in several places in the valley .
security forces resorted to firing live ammunition and teargas to control the swelling protests , in which women and children also took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters defied curfew and torched buildings four more civilians reportedly died , taking the the toll of dead in kashmir since friday to 19 , and to 36 since early june .
the latest wave of protests was sparked when a boy was killed by police gunfire almost two months ago . " we want freedom ! " at the weekend , hundreds of protesters in several neighborhoods chanted " go india !
go back ! " and " we want freedom ! " .
there were reports of some mosques being used to exhort people to come out onto the streets to protest . many see this present spell of violence as reminiscent of the late 1980s , when protests against new delhi 's rule sparked an armed conflict . the protesters , who are an assorted lot of taxi drivers , store clerks and college students , are determined to carry on their struggle and are now specifically targeting the state police .
" i think they have now realized what freedom is , " said tauseef ahmad , a college student who has been at the forefront of the protests in tangmarg , 35 kms from srinagar , the summer capital .
" for the past decade , they had no vision of what freedom is .
i think it is a birthright .
we have been victimized from every side , every nook and crook .
we have been victimized psychologically , physically and emotionally .
now is the time to change .
i think till we get freedom , we will fight and shed our blood . " " we will fight " leading the protests in srinagar 's downtown area , a volatile hotspot over the years , teenager zafar jameel was equally angry .
" we the people of kashmir are trying for freedom and we will try till we get freedom .
we will not leave these indian forces that have killed our brothers and our sisters .
we will not .
we have been fighting with our faces covered but now we will fight with our faces open .
we will fight , we will fight … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian troops have imposed a strict curfew in srinagar the government 's main worry now is that the coordinated protests will spread further into southern kashmir .
this would hit the highways and would affect the movement of essential goods as well as that of india ’ s security forces .
on monday , the cabinet committee on security held an urgent meeting at the prime minister 's residence in new delhi .
home minister p chidambaram , finance minister pranab mukherjee , defence minister a.k. antony and senior bureaucrats reviewed the crisis .
a worried chief minister omar abdullah also rushed to the capital from srinagar for consultations . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .

" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

" we have unanimously decided that i shall leave my post today , " the bearded rebel fighter said in a video posted on youtube monday .
the new leader of the islamist group " caucasus emirate " will be aslambek vadalov , described by umarov as " younger and more energetic . "
vadalov and one other man , known only as " mustafa " , appeared alongside umarov , sitting relaxed in a forest in the video message .
in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .

interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .
" the average worker is going to see a marked improvement in negotiating power , " iza director hilmar schneider told the welt am sonntag newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 02.08.2010 mexico hails drug lord coronel 's death but democracy remains at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coronel 's death may actually cause more violence not end it the killing of one of mexico 's most wanted drug cartel leaders last week is being heralded as one of the most significant victories in the on-going war against increasingly violent and militarized narcotics gangs . ignacio " nacho " coronel villareal , one of the leaders of the sinaloa cartel which is run by joachim guzman - mexico 's most wanted criminal , was killed in a shootout when troops raided his house in guadalajara on july 30 in an operation which also led to the arrest of one of his top lieutenants , iran francisco quinonez gastelum . government officials have hailed the killing as the most spectacular blow against drug traffickers yet for mexican president felipe calderon , who has been struggling to make an impact on the sinaloa cartel 's methamphetamine traffic to north america and europe or stem the violence which has claimed around 5,000 lives already this year . but while coronel 's death removes one of mexico 's drug kingpins from the picture and provides calderon with some welcome breathing space , some experts remain cautious . the lucrative nature of the drug business means that when one leader is removed , there are always many other traffickers ready to take their place so coronel 's death maybe nothing more than symbolic in the on-going battle against the cartels .
also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 02.08.2010 mexico hails drug lord coronel 's death but democracy remains at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coronel 's death may actually cause more violence not end it the killing of one of mexico 's most wanted drug cartel leaders last week is being heralded as one of the most significant victories in the on-going war against increasingly violent and militarized narcotics gangs . ignacio " nacho " coronel villareal , one of the leaders of the sinaloa cartel which is run by joachim guzman - mexico 's most wanted criminal , was killed in a shootout when troops raided his house in guadalajara on july 30 in an operation which also led to the arrest of one of his top lieutenants , iran francisco quinonez gastelum . government officials have hailed the killing as the most spectacular blow against drug traffickers yet for mexican president felipe calderon , who has been struggling to make an impact on the sinaloa cartel 's methamphetamine traffic to north america and europe or stem the violence which has claimed around 5,000 lives already this year . but while coronel 's death removes one of mexico 's drug kingpins from the picture and provides calderon with some welcome breathing space , some experts remain cautious . the lucrative nature of the drug business means that when one leader is removed , there are always many other traffickers ready to take their place so coronel 's death maybe nothing more than symbolic in the on-going battle against the cartels .
also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

pitched battles have been fought in several parts of the state . on the bloodiest day in the kashmir valley for months angry crowds on sunday torched government offices , police camps and vehicles in south kashmir , after blocking the strategic jammu-srinagar highway by felling trees and erecting stone barricades .
on monday , protesters once again defied curfew in several places in the valley .
security forces resorted to firing live ammunition and teargas to control the swelling protests , in which women and children also took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters defied curfew and torched buildings four more civilians reportedly died , taking the the toll of dead in kashmir since friday to 19 , and to 36 since early june .
the latest wave of protests was sparked when a boy was killed by police gunfire almost two months ago . " we want freedom ! " at the weekend , hundreds of protesters in several neighborhoods chanted " go india !
go back ! " and " we want freedom ! " .
there were reports of some mosques being used to exhort people to come out onto the streets to protest . many see this present spell of violence as reminiscent of the late 1980s , when protests against new delhi 's rule sparked an armed conflict . the protesters , who are an assorted lot of taxi drivers , store clerks and college students , are determined to carry on their struggle and are now specifically targeting the state police .
" i think they have now realized what freedom is , " said tauseef ahmad , a college student who has been at the forefront of the protests in tangmarg , 35 kms from srinagar , the summer capital .
" for the past decade , they had no vision of what freedom is .
i think it is a birthright .
we have been victimized from every side , every nook and crook .
we have been victimized psychologically , physically and emotionally .
now is the time to change .
i think till we get freedom , we will fight and shed our blood . " " we will fight " leading the protests in srinagar 's downtown area , a volatile hotspot over the years , teenager zafar jameel was equally angry .
" we the people of kashmir are trying for freedom and we will try till we get freedom .
we will not leave these indian forces that have killed our brothers and our sisters .
we will not .
we have been fighting with our faces covered but now we will fight with our faces open .
we will fight , we will fight … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian troops have imposed a strict curfew in srinagar the government 's main worry now is that the coordinated protests will spread further into southern kashmir .
this would hit the highways and would affect the movement of essential goods as well as that of india ’ s security forces .
on monday , the cabinet committee on security held an urgent meeting at the prime minister 's residence in new delhi .
home minister p chidambaram , finance minister pranab mukherjee , defence minister a.k. antony and senior bureaucrats reviewed the crisis .

pitched battles have been fought in several parts of the state . on the bloodiest day in the kashmir valley for months angry crowds on sunday torched government offices , police camps and vehicles in south kashmir , after blocking the strategic jammu-srinagar highway by felling trees and erecting stone barricades .
on monday , protesters once again defied curfew in several places in the valley .
security forces resorted to firing live ammunition and teargas to control the swelling protests , in which women and children also took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters defied curfew and torched buildings four more civilians reportedly died , taking the the toll of dead in kashmir since friday to 19 , and to 36 since early june .
the latest wave of protests was sparked when a boy was killed by police gunfire almost two months ago . " we want freedom ! " at the weekend , hundreds of protesters in several neighborhoods chanted " go india !
go back ! " and " we want freedom ! " .
there were reports of some mosques being used to exhort people to come out onto the streets to protest . many see this present spell of violence as reminiscent of the late 1980s , when protests against new delhi 's rule sparked an armed conflict . the protesters , who are an assorted lot of taxi drivers , store clerks and college students , are determined to carry on their struggle and are now specifically targeting the state police .
" i think they have now realized what freedom is , " said tauseef ahmad , a college student who has been at the forefront of the protests in tangmarg , 35 kms from srinagar , the summer capital .
" for the past decade , they had no vision of what freedom is .
i think it is a birthright .
we have been victimized from every side , every nook and crook .
we have been victimized psychologically , physically and emotionally .
now is the time to change .
i think till we get freedom , we will fight and shed our blood . " " we will fight " leading the protests in srinagar 's downtown area , a volatile hotspot over the years , teenager zafar jameel was equally angry .
" we the people of kashmir are trying for freedom and we will try till we get freedom .
we will not leave these indian forces that have killed our brothers and our sisters .
we will not .
we have been fighting with our faces covered but now we will fight with our faces open .
we will fight , we will fight … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian troops have imposed a strict curfew in srinagar the government 's main worry now is that the coordinated protests will spread further into southern kashmir .
this would hit the highways and would affect the movement of essential goods as well as that of india ’ s security forces .
on monday , the cabinet committee on security held an urgent meeting at the prime minister 's residence in new delhi .
home minister p chidambaram , finance minister pranab mukherjee , defence minister a.k. antony and senior bureaucrats reviewed the crisis .
a worried chief minister omar abdullah also rushed to the capital from srinagar for consultations . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .
" the average worker is going to see a marked improvement in negotiating power , " iza director hilmar schneider told the welt am sonntag newspaper .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 02.08.2010 anti-islam party to feature in dutch minority government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilders , leader of dutch far-right party freedom party geert wilders , whose anti-immigration party doubled its vote in june 's elections , is set to play a key role in the new government .
his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .
the iraqi dicator was executed in 2006 for crimes against humanity but the legacy of his 1990 invasion of kuwait lives on . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 02.08.2010 duisburg mayor prepared to be voted out after love parade disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland has been called a ' rat ' by duisburg residents a week after the death of 21 people at the love parade festival in duisburg , the mayor of the western german city , adolf sauerland , is preparing to face a city council vote which could force him to resign . adolf sauerland is ready to face a vote in the city council on his future as mayor of duisburg , the western german city where 21 people died after being crushed to death at the love parade music festival on july 24 .
sauerland , who has been under pressure to resign over the city 's organization of the event , said in a statement monday that he " will face up to his responsibilities - both personal and political . "
no-confidence vote several parties as well as the people of duisburg have been calling for his resignation .
the process of voting him out is complex , but he would be most likely to have to step down once two thirds of the city councilors vote for him to go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland could face a no-confidence vote " of course , and i 've said this before , i 'm prepared to face being voted out according to the regulations of the state of north rhine-westphalia , " sauerland said in the statement .
sauerland has not appeared in public since shortly after the disaster , and has communicated only in writing and through interviews with selected newspapers .
but if sauerland , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , gets enough support from his fellow party members , he could stave off the vote of no-confidence .
looking for answers in the meantime , sauerland has launched an inquiry into the handling of the love parade festival , in which 21 people where killed on july 24 , and over 500 injured .
on monday , five people were still being treated in hospital .
the dead were crushed as they were led into an overcrowded access tunnel to the techno music festival .
around 1,000 duisburg residents have signed a petition demanding sauerland 's resignation .
the left party and the social democratic groups in the duisburg city council have also called for him to step down .
german president christian wulff said he should accept political responsibility , and pointed out that this did not mean he would be admitting personal guilt over the deaths . an interim police report last wednesday put the blame on organizers , listing a catalog of catastrophic mistakes in managing a crowd of hundreds of thousands on a site that was not suitable for that many people .
prosecutors have opened an investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 02.08.2010 duisburg mayor prepared to be voted out after love parade disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland has been called a ' rat ' by duisburg residents a week after the death of 21 people at the love parade festival in duisburg , the mayor of the western german city , adolf sauerland , is preparing to face a city council vote which could force him to resign . adolf sauerland is ready to face a vote in the city council on his future as mayor of duisburg , the western german city where 21 people died after being crushed to death at the love parade music festival on july 24 .
sauerland , who has been under pressure to resign over the city 's organization of the event , said in a statement monday that he " will face up to his responsibilities - both personal and political . "
no-confidence vote several parties as well as the people of duisburg have been calling for his resignation .
the process of voting him out is complex , but he would be most likely to have to step down once two thirds of the city councilors vote for him to go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland could face a no-confidence vote " of course , and i 've said this before , i 'm prepared to face being voted out according to the regulations of the state of north rhine-westphalia , " sauerland said in the statement .
sauerland has not appeared in public since shortly after the disaster , and has communicated only in writing and through interviews with selected newspapers .
but if sauerland , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , gets enough support from his fellow party members , he could stave off the vote of no-confidence .
looking for answers in the meantime , sauerland has launched an inquiry into the handling of the love parade festival , in which 21 people where killed on july 24 , and over 500 injured .
on monday , five people were still being treated in hospital .
the dead were crushed as they were led into an overcrowded access tunnel to the techno music festival .
around 1,000 duisburg residents have signed a petition demanding sauerland 's resignation .
the left party and the social democratic groups in the duisburg city council have also called for him to step down .
german president christian wulff said he should accept political responsibility , and pointed out that this did not mean he would be admitting personal guilt over the deaths . an interim police report last wednesday put the blame on organizers , listing a catalog of catastrophic mistakes in managing a crowd of hundreds of thousands on a site that was not suitable for that many people .
prosecutors have opened an investigation .

the blame game wulff did not refrain from participating in the ongoing blame game underlying the media and political discussion of the tragedy , which has been calling for duisburg 's lord mayor adolf sauerland to take the fall .
" we all know that not just one person is responsible , " said wulff , at the same time indirectly suggesting that sauerland should resign .
" independent of concrete , personal culpability , there is still a political responsibility , " wulff said , adding that sauerland should " weigh closely " what that meant .
as germany searches for someone to accept blame for the tragedy , love parade organizer rainer schaller and duisburg city authorities have continued to point fingers at one another .
both schaller and sauerland have promised to accept responsibility for their roles in the love parade disaster , but say their first responsibility lies in aiding the police investigation into the tragedy .
bildunterschrift : thousands mourned in duisburg saturday sauerland absent from memorials sauerland and schaller were not present saturday when thousands gathered in duisburg to commemorate the love parade 's victims .
in attendance at a religious service in duisburg 's salvator church were president wulff , along with chancellor angela merkel , state premier hannelore kraft and foreign minister guido westerwelle .
after the church memorial , an estimated 5,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy .
organizers of a second processional on sunday collected funds to erect a commemorative plaque .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

sauerland , who has been under pressure to resign over the city 's organization of the event , said in a statement monday that he " will face up to his responsibilities - both personal and political . "
no-confidence vote several parties as well as the people of duisburg have been calling for his resignation .
the process of voting him out is complex , but he would be most likely to have to step down once two thirds of the city councilors vote for him to go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland could face a no-confidence vote " of course , and i 've said this before , i 'm prepared to face being voted out according to the regulations of the state of north rhine-westphalia , " sauerland said in the statement .
sauerland has not appeared in public since shortly after the disaster , and has communicated only in writing and through interviews with selected newspapers .
but if sauerland , who is from chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , gets enough support from his fellow party members , he could stave off the vote of no-confidence .
looking for answers in the meantime , sauerland has launched an inquiry into the handling of the love parade festival , in which 21 people where killed on july 24 , and over 500 injured .
on monday , five people were still being treated in hospital .
the dead were crushed as they were led into an overcrowded access tunnel to the techno music festival .
around 1,000 duisburg residents have signed a petition demanding sauerland 's resignation .
the left party and the social democratic groups in the duisburg city council have also called for him to step down .
german president christian wulff said he should accept political responsibility , and pointed out that this did not mean he would be admitting personal guilt over the deaths . an interim police report last wednesday put the blame on organizers , listing a catalog of catastrophic mistakes in managing a crowd of hundreds of thousands on a site that was not suitable for that many people .
prosecutors have opened an investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.08.2010 twenty years on , shockwaves of kuwait invasion are still felt in middle east 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's invasion of kuwait and desert storm were just the start on august 2 , 1990 , iraq launched an invasion of kuwait , setting in motion a long chain of events which have reshaped the middle east and have changed the dynamic of relations between the western and arab worlds . in 1990 , iraq was a very different place to the one it is now .
the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .
the iraqi dicator was executed in 2006 for crimes against humanity but the legacy of his 1990 invasion of kuwait lives on . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .

" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .

" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .

he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 02.08.2010 mexico hails drug lord coronel 's death but democracy remains at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coronel 's death may actually cause more violence not end it the killing of one of mexico 's most wanted drug cartel leaders last week is being heralded as one of the most significant victories in the on-going war against increasingly violent and militarized narcotics gangs . ignacio " nacho " coronel villareal , one of the leaders of the sinaloa cartel which is run by joachim guzman - mexico 's most wanted criminal , was killed in a shootout when troops raided his house in guadalajara on july 30 in an operation which also led to the arrest of one of his top lieutenants , iran francisco quinonez gastelum . government officials have hailed the killing as the most spectacular blow against drug traffickers yet for mexican president felipe calderon , who has been struggling to make an impact on the sinaloa cartel 's methamphetamine traffic to north america and europe or stem the violence which has claimed around 5,000 lives already this year . but while coronel 's death removes one of mexico 's drug kingpins from the picture and provides calderon with some welcome breathing space , some experts remain cautious . the lucrative nature of the drug business means that when one leader is removed , there are always many other traffickers ready to take their place so coronel 's death maybe nothing more than symbolic in the on-going battle against the cartels .
also , the arrest or killing of top bosses in the past have led to increased violence , sometimes through retribution , other times through rival gangs taking advantage of the power vacuum . there are fears that guadalajara , which has been spared the bloodshed suffered by other cities around mexico , may now be more vulnerable to cartel violence and turf wars .
this was the case when the military killed another prominent figure , arturo beltran leyva , in december .
his death set off gunfights in the previously more stable city of acapulco .
the death of one cartel leader , however prominent , is unlikely to make a huge difference in a war which is threatening the very structure of mexico .
despite the government 's efforts to fight the cartels , violence is on the rise .
the country is not a failed state yet but the drug trade poses a serious threat to mexico 's democratic institutions .
democratic institutions at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-year long war has claimed thousands of lives just days before recent regional elections , the leading candidate for governor in a mexican border state was assassinated by gunmen .
the murder of a high-level politician rocked a country in which violent crime and drug wars have become a fact of life .
according to estimates , 25,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug trade since president felipe calderon launched his war against mexico 's drug gangs four years ago .
" the murder of a local mayor does n't necessarily make it on the front page of the newspapers anymore , it must be someone more prominent these days , " frank priess told deutsche welle , putting the recent assassination in a larger context .
priess has been heading the mexico city branch of the konrad adenauer foundation , which is connected to germany 's christian democratic party , since 2006 .
in a study , the us defense department had already warned back in early 2009 that mexico due to its drug crimes could become a failed state .
that discussion has been revived in us media after the recent spate of violence in mexico .
but experts interviewed by deutsche welle , do n't consider mexico a failed state or even a failing state yet , despite an increasing level of violence and grim statistics .
government still controls most of mexico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's military is fighting cartels all over the country the question whether mexico , which seems incapable over a extended period of time to defeat an identifiable armed opponent that is targeting the state , its security apparatus , parts of the population and its rivals , is a failed state , is legitimate , says thomas fischer , director of the center for latin american studies at the catholic university in eichstaett : " but on the other hand it is a fact that despite the violence , the most important institutions in mexico - which handle its economic , monetary and financial policies , but also its infrastructure and its social systems - are working . "
his colleague priess offers another reason : " there are areas which the government obviously does n't control any longer .
but this is definitely not the case for all of mexico and also not for the majority of the country . "
still , mexico , the 12th-largest economy in the world according to purchasing power-adjusted gdp is in dire straits .
and the experts see no easy way out for the nation that is not only a vital member of the north american free trade zone nafta , but also has a free trade agreement with the european union . " i do n't think one can expect that anything will change in the near term , " says priess .
drug cartels influence political life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rampant violence has changed mexican society he is deeply concerned about the mounting political influence of organised crime in certain mexican states .
by targeting and killing undesirable politicians , the drug cartels have sent the clear message that no politician or official can feel safe , adds priess .
that has had the chilling effect that in some communities it has been difficult to find candidates for political office .
" and that is obviously a very direct influence by drug cartels and organised crime on the political life in mexico that simply ca n't be underestimated , " says priess .
what makes combating the drug cartels so difficult is the fact that the rampant drug trade is only part of a larger problem for mexico .
the country which was ruled for 70 years by the institutional revolutionary party still lacks a mature civil society , argue the experts .
" when one looks at mexico 's history , political assassinations have never been just a few rare events , but rather common , " says fischer who adds that the same holds true for corruption which also has a long tradition in mexico . while a tradition of assassinations and corruption is problematic in and of itself , combined with the drug trade it produces a lethal mix for mexican society .
poison for democracy " the narcotraffico , with all that it implies - arms trade , extortion , corruption , money laundering - and especially the disregard for social norms represent an enormous threat for democracy and most importantly for the basic values which are the foundation of a democracy , " says fischer .
" that is poison for a country which has been governed for 70 years by a de-facto one party regime . "
both experts agree that the military solution to the drug trade , that mexico 's president after prodding and with the help of the us has launched , wo n't be effective . instead of short-sighted military options , mexico with its decentralised political structure must undertake far-reaching administrative and social reforms , argue the experts .
bildunterschrift : the military seize huge amounts of drugs , but still only a fraction of the overall drug trade " mexico has almost 2,000 independently organized police units , " says priess .
" every community is responsible how it hires , trains , pays its police and how they communicate with other police units and citizens .
that is incredibly inefficient . "
what 's more , note the experts , the mexican government , in order to win back the trust of its citizens , has to rebuild its justice , security and political apparatus which has been undermined und infiltrated by organised crime .
and finally , the country must improve its education and social systems , so young people have an alternative to joining the ranks of the drug cartels .
" unfortunately , there is no masterplan , " says priess .
but if mexico does n't begin to tackle the problems soon , it could become a narco state like colombia was .
only much bigger and with its 3,000 kilometer-long -lrb- 1,860-mile -rrb- border with the united states .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .

his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .

among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .

" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .

" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .

skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .

bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .

kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .

" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .

"
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .
" the average worker is going to see a marked improvement in negotiating power , " iza director hilmar schneider told the welt am sonntag newspaper .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .

" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .

kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .

" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

while wulff refused to point fingers , he hinted that duisburg 's mayor should consider resigning . german president christian wulff has proposed the immediate founding of a fund to support the families of the love parade tragedy .
talking to the national sunday tabloid bild am sonntag , wulff also suggested appointing an ombudsperson to address the difficulties facing the parties involved in the crushing death of 21 german and international visitors at last saturday 's love parade techno festival in duisburg .
" we now all have a responsibility to those in duisburg , " wulff added .
the blame game wulff did not refrain from participating in the ongoing blame game underlying the media and political discussion of the tragedy , which has been calling for duisburg 's lord mayor adolf sauerland to take the fall .
" we all know that not just one person is responsible , " said wulff , at the same time indirectly suggesting that sauerland should resign .
" independent of concrete , personal culpability , there is still a political responsibility , " wulff said , adding that sauerland should " weigh closely " what that meant .
as germany searches for someone to accept blame for the tragedy , love parade organizer rainer schaller and duisburg city authorities have continued to point fingers at one another .
both schaller and sauerland have promised to accept responsibility for their roles in the love parade disaster , but say their first responsibility lies in aiding the police investigation into the tragedy .
bildunterschrift : thousands mourned in duisburg saturday sauerland absent from memorials sauerland and schaller were not present saturday when thousands gathered in duisburg to commemorate the love parade 's victims .
in attendance at a religious service in duisburg 's salvator church were president wulff , along with chancellor angela merkel , state premier hannelore kraft and foreign minister guido westerwelle .
after the church memorial , an estimated 5,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy .
organizers of a second processional on sunday collected funds to erect a commemorative plaque .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

while wulff refused to point fingers , he hinted that duisburg 's mayor should consider resigning . german president christian wulff has proposed the immediate founding of a fund to support the families of the love parade tragedy .
talking to the national sunday tabloid bild am sonntag , wulff also suggested appointing an ombudsperson to address the difficulties facing the parties involved in the crushing death of 21 german and international visitors at last saturday 's love parade techno festival in duisburg .
" we now all have a responsibility to those in duisburg , " wulff added .
the blame game wulff did not refrain from participating in the ongoing blame game underlying the media and political discussion of the tragedy , which has been calling for duisburg 's lord mayor adolf sauerland to take the fall .
" we all know that not just one person is responsible , " said wulff , at the same time indirectly suggesting that sauerland should resign .
" independent of concrete , personal culpability , there is still a political responsibility , " wulff said , adding that sauerland should " weigh closely " what that meant .
as germany searches for someone to accept blame for the tragedy , love parade organizer rainer schaller and duisburg city authorities have continued to point fingers at one another .
both schaller and sauerland have promised to accept responsibility for their roles in the love parade disaster , but say their first responsibility lies in aiding the police investigation into the tragedy .
bildunterschrift : thousands mourned in duisburg saturday sauerland absent from memorials sauerland and schaller were not present saturday when thousands gathered in duisburg to commemorate the love parade 's victims .
in attendance at a religious service in duisburg 's salvator church were president wulff , along with chancellor angela merkel , state premier hannelore kraft and foreign minister guido westerwelle .
after the church memorial , an estimated 5,000 people gathered saturday afternoon in a mourning processional to the site of the tragedy .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 02.08.2010 anti-islam party to feature in dutch minority government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geert wilders , leader of dutch far-right party freedom party geert wilders , whose anti-immigration party doubled its vote in june 's elections , is set to play a key role in the new government .
his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

" we have unanimously decided that i shall leave my post today , " the bearded rebel fighter said in a video posted on youtube monday .
the new leader of the islamist group " caucasus emirate " will be aslambek vadalov , described by umarov as " younger and more energetic . "
vadalov and one other man , known only as " mustafa " , appeared alongside umarov , sitting relaxed in a forest in the video message .
in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

" we have unanimously decided that i shall leave my post today , " the bearded rebel fighter said in a video posted on youtube monday .
the new leader of the islamist group " caucasus emirate " will be aslambek vadalov , described by umarov as " younger and more energetic . "
vadalov and one other man , known only as " mustafa " , appeared alongside umarov , sitting relaxed in a forest in the video message .
in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .
as the country recovers from the global economic crisis , some companies are already struggling to find qualified workers to fill positions .
the financial times deutschland reported that the chemical company lanxess , formerly part of the bayer group , was " desperately looking for specialists at all levels . "
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be short of more than 200,000 engineers , scientists and technicians .
european blue card is under development government spokesman steegmans pointed out that the german government was currently already working on a so-called blue card , which would also be targeted at migrant workers .
the blue card follows the model of the us green card , and would make it easier for those with university degrees and at least five years experience to find work in the eu .

attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said .

" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

the latest round of in-fighting comes over a call to end pension guarantees . in the latest public spat , german economy minister rainer bruederle attacked the pace of the reforms being carried out by the coalition .
bruederle , from merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took a swipe at chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" we were surprised to discover that the our preferred coalition partner the cdu has moved so far away from its earlier willingness for reforms and from its earlier line on economic policy , " bruederle told the german daily newspaper handelsblatt on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle signalled frustration over coalition economic policy bruederle went on to attack the cdu for what he perceived as a failure to adhere sufficiently to market economics .
" frau merkel is a successful chancellor , " said bruederle .
" however , at the same time , she is the leader of a party whose market economy wing does n't always have it easy . "
crucially , bruederle called for an end to a guarantee on the level of income that pensioners receive .
those comments prompted horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , to criticize bruederle for stirring trouble .
he blamed the arguments for slipping poll ratings for coalition parties .
bruederle 's comments were " exasperating , " seehofer told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's saturday edition , adding that the debate was pointless and that it could only cause upset and uncertainty among voters .
" pension cuts are not on the agenda and would also not be supported by the csu under any circumstances , " he said .
fuel to the debate however , more fuel was added to the debate by stanislaw tillich , cdu premier of the state of saxony , who said that the pension system would eventually need reform .
" there will not be such a pension guarantee in the long term because young people can not be permanently burdened in this way , " he told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he was exasperated by the pension debate a number of other cloudy issues remain to be resolved by the coalition parties , with parliament due to resume in september .
among them are nuclear power - which sparked public controversy within the alliance a week earlier - wider welfare reform steps and tax cuts .
merkel is currently taking a three-week holiday in the italian alps and commentators are posing questions .
" the government has no plan , " wrote german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag columnist michael backhaus .
" it 's coming apart at the seams with petty fights about every issue imaginable .
the big question is ' what does this government want ? ' . "
the coalition is backed by only 34 percent of the electorate according to a poll for the german weekly magazine stern , down from more than 48 percent in last year 's september election .
together , the cdu and csu had the backing of 29 percent of voters , in the poll published last wednesday , while the fdp had 5 percent .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .

by february 25 , operation desert storm had decimated iraqi forces and pushed them out of kuwait , officially liberating the country . coalition forces pursued the retreating iraqi army into iraq but called off the advance four days into the ground assault , some 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- from baghdad .
in the days which followed the ceasefire , a peace summit was held and an agreement to end hostilities was signed by all parties .
coalition forces slowly retreated from iraq and by the end of march 1991 , the majority of us troops had left the persian gulf . some us troops stayed , however .
many of those who had been sent to saudi arabia to protect the country before the invasion of kuwait as part of operation desert shield remained there .
about 5,000 us military personnel continued to be stationed at the base in dhahran and were involved in enforcing the no-fly zone over southern iraq as part of operation southern watch , a coalition air patrol mission sanctioned by the un in 1992 to prevent continuing air attacks by iraqi forces on shi 'ite muslims . " the us had an access-to-facilities agreement with oman dating back to 1980 as well as small-scale agreements with bahrain and the wide range of military agreements it had with saudi arabia dating back to the 1940s , but it was nothing like the visible and large-scale military footprint that it assumed post-1990 , " dr. ulrichsen said . " in this sense , the invasion of kuwait and its consequences were transformative in terms of the level and nature of us military commitment to the gulf and wider middle east . " us presence and action stokes growing arab anger the us military presence in the gulf was called into action again in 1998 when us president bill clinton ordered four days of air strikes on iraq after seven years of non-compliance with un disarmament orders and baghdad 's continued rejection of weapons inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden based his jihad on us army presence in holy lands while this action and other smaller strikes reminded the world that the us had saddam contained and the region protected , some of iraq 's arab neighbors were beginning to tire of the american presence .
others were starting to foment more extreme emotions and ideas . " the arabs of the region did n't know what to think after the war , " said hazhir teimourian .
" removing saddam might have created a vacuum into which iran might have stepped but they also feared what would happen if the great powers were allowed to remove dictators . " " they hoped saddam would now be much weaker and even learn his lesson .
but the shias of iraq felt betrayed by the us for allowing saddam to remain in power .
america had urged them to rise against him and they did , but then he was allowed to get away with more mass crimes against them . " " there was a gradual shift in popular opinion during the 1990s in the gulf states toward a more skeptical view of us motives although many relied on the united states for their external security , " dr. ulrichsen added .
" when al qaeda emerged in the 1990s , its initial propaganda was based on the rejection of the presence of us-foreign military forces in the holy land of the arabian peninsula .
this was an integral part of osama bin laden 's call to arms in his february 1998 ' declaration of jihad against jews and crusaders . " ' bin laden 's jihad would , of course , lead to the terrorist attacks on the us in september 2001 which would be used as the justification for the subsequent wars in afghanistan and the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , conflicts in which the us is still involved today . after choosing not to remove saddam from power in 1991 , the us finally brought down his regime 12 years later in a military campaign largely influenced by terrorist atrocities planned in part as a response to its presence in the gulf .
the iraqi dicator was executed in 2006 for crimes against humanity but the legacy of his 1990 invasion of kuwait lives on . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .
economic experts in germany have warned that by 2014 , the country will be lacking more than 200,000 engineers , scientists , and technicians .
many german companies are already complaining about a shortage of skilled workers .
lack of child care keeps skilled women at home weise says that it 's first and foremost up to companies to do more to attract qualified employees ; looking abroad should be a last resort .
" those companies which want to attract and keep qualified workers have to offer something , and they can do this themselves ; they do n't need to turn to legislators , " weise said , citing a lack of child care programs as one example of a hurdle discouraging qualified women from re-entering the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise says germany needs to tap into the potential of its own workforce before going abroad " there simply are n't enough child care options , and given the current crisis , communities are n't in a position to do anything about it , " weise said .
" it 's also up to employers and employees to organize things in a way that they can combine work and family . "
meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

" we have to use the potential we already have here in the country , " frank-juergen weise , head of the federal labor agency , told the financial times deutschland on monday .
" we ca n't allow people to remain in unemployment only because their talents are n't being used . "
last week , bruederle called for germany to open its doors to skilled workers abroad , and suggested that businesses use financial incentives to attract employees .

meanwhile , bavarian state premier horst seehofer also took aim at the measures proposed by bruederle , telling the business daily handelsblatt that the first step should be getting people out of work and back into jobs .
" the things we should be focusing on are education , qualifications and further training , " seehofer said .
according to handelsblatt , however , many german companies are already discreetly searching for qualified workers such as it and medical specialists in other parts of the world via english- , russian- , and polish-language internet platforms , despite the fact that there 's been an official ban on the active recruitment of foreign workers in germany since 1973 .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

his party is to join the netherland 's first minority coalition since world war ii . seven weeks after the dutch parliamentary elections , geert wilders , the leader of the anti-islam , anti-immigrant freedom party -lrb- ppv -rrb- , is poised to become a key voice in what could be the most conservative dutch government in history .
on sunday , the liberal people 's party for freedom and democracy -lrb- vvd -rrb- agreed on a minority coalition with the center-right christian democrats , backed on a case-by-case basis by the freedom party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutte 's party won 31 seats , one more than the social democratic labour party mark rutte , the leader of the vvd party and likely to be the next prime minister , said he sees enough similarities for cooperation .
" we discussed all the major issues , from budget cuts to security to migration .
we have n't debated yet , but we have come to believe that there is enough trust between us to start negotiations , " said rutte .
looming doubts however , the christian democrats , the smaller of the two partners in the possible minority government , are struggling with the idea of being dependent on wilders ' whims .
interim parliamentary leader maxime verhagen was left little choice after center-left coalition talks broke down .
" we are not going to just sweep the differences under the carpet , but rather , we must accept them .
and we must accept that the partners will act in accordance with their principles , " verhagen said .
many christian democrats have voiced their displeasure over the plans for a minority government : the former parliamentary president weisglas accused the party leadership of selling out to wilders .
a regional party leader said the whole thing gave him a stomach ache .
points of tension the christian democratic party has suffered a turbulent year .
in february , the centrist coalition government between the christian democrats and the labour party collapsed when labour refused to extend the dutch contribution to the nato force in afghanistan , prompting a new election .
during the election campaigning , religious and cultural issues took a back seat to economic concerns , said arjen berkvens , the director of the alfred mozer stichting , an amsterdam foundation linked to the labor party .
however , the role of islam promises to be a point of tension between the party for freedom and the christian democrats .
wilders has compared the koran to " mein kampf " and blamed islamic texts for inciting the september 11 terrorist attacks .
he calls islam a " political ideology " - a description the christian democrats oppose .
the christian democrats also oppose wilder 's proposed ban on headscarves , which they regards as unconstitutional .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilders has advocated for a ' headscarf tax ' in the netherlands chance for stability berkvens says that , all the same , the minority coalition could be a stable option - if wilders can contain his divisive radicalism .
" the christian democrats and the liberals agree on almost all the social economic issues - changing the welfare state , introducing privatization of healthcare , so there will be no unstable situation regarding policies , " berkvens said .
wilders ' divisive statements about islam make him something of a wild card . yet for the time , wilders seems eager to make the coalition work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 5 % of the dutch population is muslim " we will show that we are a reliable party , and that things can work , " the 46-year-old wilders said . " but we can also continue to say what we want .
our goal is that the government will be successful in making the netherlands a better , stronger and safer country - with less immigration and asylum . "
in the netherlands , analysts are hopeful that a new minority coalition government could be official by the third tuesday of september , the official opening of the dutch political season .
but even with the votes of wilders ' party , the minority government will have a majority of just one .

the country was under the control of the dictator saddam hussein who , at the time , enjoyed good relations with many of the western nations who would later repel his forces from kuwait , isolate his country through military and legal force , and finally depose him .
iraq was also a respected nation in the region , although one which smaller arab nations were wary of .
" iraq was seen as the regional bulwark against the spread of revolutionary political islam from iran , which was an important point for the conservative sunni monarchies of the arabian peninsula , who recalled the overspill of iranian attempts to export its revolution in the immediate aftermath of 1979 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , deputy director of the kuwait programme at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" although most of the gulf cooperation council states had supported iraq during its 1980-88 war with iran - saudi arabia was a particularly strong ally - the smaller gcc states were wary of iraqi power and ambitions in the gulf . "
kuwait itself was also a close iraqi ally before the events of august 1990 .
it was one of iraq 's staunchest supporters in its war with iran , heavily financing the iraqi side of the conflict and acting as a military hub when the fighting knocked out strategic cities like basra .
when the war was over , however , relations turned sour .
kuwait wanted its money back .
iraq refused to pay , arguing that its war with iran had prevented the rise of tehran 's influence over the arab world .
" the arabs knew that saddam had brought ruin and misery to the region , and he was a dangerous bully who might do even more dreadful things , but they had to be pragmatic , " hazhir teimourian , a middle east analyst and commentator with the limehouse group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" his invasion of iran had ended in a stalemate but he presented it as a triumph .
he expected the whole world , let alone the arabs , to be grateful to him that he had stopped the tide of iranian fundamentalist expansionism . "
in early 1990 , the arguments over the war debt expanded , with iraq first accusing kuwait of stealing from its oil supplies and then claiming that kuwaiti over-production of its own oil was driving down the price of iraqi crude .
the stage was set for military action after a series of emergency meetings between the two arab neighbors failed to find a solution .
us initially stood aside and took neutral position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us withdrew its support for saddam over the kuwait invasion before kuwait was over-run and occupied for seven months by the iraqi military , the united states , in a response which now seems difficult to imagine , announced that washington " inspired by friendship and not by confrontation , does not have an opinion " on the increasing tensions .
" we have no opinion on arab-arab conflicts , " a white house statement read .
" the united states had provided indirect support to iraq during the iran-iraq war , had turned a blind eye to saddam hussein 's regime 's actions against iraq 's kurdish population in 1988 and against the bombing of the uss stark in 1987 , " dr. ulrichsen said .
" the us ambassador to iraq , april glaspie , appeared to adopt a tacitly neutral position toward iraqi-kuwait border issues during her meeting with saddam hussein on july 25th , 1990 , which was interpreted by saddam as giving him an indication that the us would not intervene if iraq took military action against kuwait . "
less than three weeks later , after the elite iraqi republican guard backed by iraqi special forces had captured kuwait city , the country 's airports and military airbases , saddam hussein abolished the state of kuwait , announced the creation of the 19th province of iraq and forced the kuwaiti royal family into exile , installing his own self-appointed prime minister and governor to rule .
unanimous international condemnation of the invasion followed .
even traditionally close allies such as france and india joined the voices calling for an immediate withdrawal .
the soviet union and china placed an arms embargo on iraq while the un security council passed 12 resolutions demanding immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait .
the pressure , however , had no effect . " there was a lot of admiration for saddam 's daring in the arab world , " said hazhir teimourian .
" the ordinary arab on the street hoped he would go on to unite the whole arab world behind him .
the palestinians loved him in particular and felt sure he would go on to destroy israel .
but the governments felt otherwise , as a result , some arab countries sent token forces to be part of the coalition to evict him from kuwait once it became clear that the us would do so anyway .

" we have unanimously decided that i shall leave my post today , " the bearded rebel fighter said in a video posted on youtube monday .
the new leader of the islamist group " caucasus emirate " will be aslambek vadalov , described by umarov as " younger and more energetic . "
vadalov and one other man , known only as " mustafa " , appeared alongside umarov , sitting relaxed in a forest in the video message .
in recent years , russia 's most wanted guerrilla umarov brought a string of disjointed rebel groups in several southern russian regions together , styling himself as the leader of the new " caucasus emirate " group - an organization fighting for independence from russia and the introduction of sharia , or islamic , law in the north caucasus .
still a fighter umarov has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months , including the march 29 bombings of the moscow metro that killed at least 40 people .
he became head of the chechen guerilla movement in june 2006 , following in the footsteps of the notorious shamil basayev , who was responsible for the 2004 hostage siege of a school in beslan that killed over 330 people .
" this stepping down does not mean that i give up jihad , " umarov , bearded and wearing a national skullcap , said in a video address posted on the website www.kavkazcenter.com.
" i will do whatever i can by word and deed , " he added .
umarov , who has been on moscow 's most wanted list for years , has led a rebellion that started as a separatist insurgency seeking independence from moscow , but has now developed into a broader islamist movement looking to establish an " emirate " across the caucasus mountains .

so should workers get a raise , or make do with what they earn now ? peter bofinger , one of germany 's economic " wise men , " says it 's time for a hefty increase in german wage levels .
" we need stronger wage increases of at least 3 percent , " he told the monday edition of the rheinische post newspaper .
bofinger said that a cautionary approach to wage hikes in recent years has led to a gap in the national economies of the eurozone .
his remedy ?
higher wage increases in germany and lower increases in the less competitive economies of southern europe .
in his view , german businesses can afford larger increases , which he predicts would stimulate consumer spending , thus helping the economic recovery .
" there 's no justification for the extreme slowdown in wage development in recent years , " bofinger said .
in 2008 , german salaries still registered an average rate of increase of 3 percent .
but since then , that rate has slowed sharply .
caution still needed , says hundt however , the current situation suits dieter hundt , president of the german employers ' association -lrb- bda -rrb- , just fine .
despite the fact that the german economy is undergoing a modest recovery , hundt does n't see any reason to increase wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , left , believes it 's not party time yet " we must n't burden or threaten the current economic recovery in any way , " hundt said on sunday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
he added that workers are already benefitting from the fact that schemes involving reduced working hours , which were introduced at the height of the crisis , are now being phased out .
hundt said germany 's moderate wage increase policy had helped companies emerge from the financial crisis relatively unscathed .
he is anticipating economic growth of 2 percent this year , as well as a decrease in unemployment to below the 3 million mark .
but hundt also pointed out that exports are largely responsible for these positive developments : germany 's domestic recovery , on the other hand , is still sluggish .
" it 's not party time yet , " he said .
wage hike inevitable , researchers say also weighing in on the debate , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu , said he can understand german workers ' demands for a substantial pay increase .
german trade unions showed remarkable restraint and responsibility during the crisis , so it 's only to be expected that workers now want a tangible reward , seehofer told public broadcaster ard .
some labor market experts predict that , after years of stagnation , germans are headed for an era of larger wage hikes .
the kiel economic research institute foresees a net wage increase of over 4 percent in 2013 and 2014 - a development driven also by germany 's labor shortage .
this was confirmed by the iza research institute on labor trends .
" the average worker is going to see a marked improvement in negotiating power , " iza director hilmar schneider told the welt am sonntag newspaper .

pitched battles have been fought in several parts of the state . on the bloodiest day in the kashmir valley for months angry crowds on sunday torched government offices , police camps and vehicles in south kashmir , after blocking the strategic jammu-srinagar highway by felling trees and erecting stone barricades .
on monday , protesters once again defied curfew in several places in the valley .
security forces resorted to firing live ammunition and teargas to control the swelling protests , in which women and children also took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters defied curfew and torched buildings four more civilians reportedly died , taking the the toll of dead in kashmir since friday to 19 , and to 36 since early june .
the latest wave of protests was sparked when a boy was killed by police gunfire almost two months ago . " we want freedom ! " at the weekend , hundreds of protesters in several neighborhoods chanted " go india !
go back ! " and " we want freedom ! " .
there were reports of some mosques being used to exhort people to come out onto the streets to protest . many see this present spell of violence as reminiscent of the late 1980s , when protests against new delhi 's rule sparked an armed conflict . the protesters , who are an assorted lot of taxi drivers , store clerks and college students , are determined to carry on their struggle and are now specifically targeting the state police .
" i think they have now realized what freedom is , " said tauseef ahmad , a college student who has been at the forefront of the protests in tangmarg , 35 kms from srinagar , the summer capital .
" for the past decade , they had no vision of what freedom is .
i think it is a birthright .
we have been victimized from every side , every nook and crook .
we have been victimized psychologically , physically and emotionally .
now is the time to change .
i think till we get freedom , we will fight and shed our blood . " " we will fight " leading the protests in srinagar 's downtown area , a volatile hotspot over the years , teenager zafar jameel was equally angry .
" we the people of kashmir are trying for freedom and we will try till we get freedom .
we will not leave these indian forces that have killed our brothers and our sisters .

she was responding to calls from the german economy minister to open the german labor market to skilled foreigners . german chancellor angela merkel has rejected plans by the german economy minister , rainer bruederle , to make it easier for skilled foreign workers to find jobs in germany .
it was unnecessary to amend the law controlling migrant workers at present , said government spokesman christoph steegmans on monday .
the law , which came into force in january 2009 , made it easier for foreigners who had trained in germany to find work in the country .
it also lowered the minimum income needed for a foreign worker to secure a german residence permit to 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,250 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skilled workers are in demand as the economy recovers from recession bruederle said last week that the government should consider lowering the limit .
his other proposals included offering a welcome bonus to foreign workers who chose to relocate to germany .
bruederle clarified that it would be up to individual companies , rather than the state , to act on this incentive .
" the issue of how to finally make germany attractive to skilled migrants is at the top of my agenda , " bruederle told the business daily , the handelsblatt , on friday .
but the head of germany 's federal labor agency , frank-juergen weise , and the premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , both said that german companies should do more to employ germans who are out of a job before seeking staff abroad .
skilled workers are in demand the debate over foreign workers comes as german companies are facing a shortage of skilled labor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 02.08.2010 telecom providers unfazed by major security hole in mobile networks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all pre-3g gsm phones conceiveably are vulnerable to paget 's snooping technique by mimicking cell phone towers , hackers can listen on calls , but the industry is n't worried .
attacks like these used to cost millions , but now they only cost about 1,100 euros . on saturday , chris paget , an american computer security researcher , revealed how he could tap mobile calls using $ 1,500 worth of radio equipment and an antenna .
he showed , while presenting at the defcon hackers conference in las vegas , how his device broadcasts a gsm signal , allowing it to pose as a cell phone tower .
the device only works on mobile phones using the second-generation of the gsm standard , which is used by the overwhelming majority of mobile phone users around the globe .
however , the ability to listen in on calls does not apply to the more secure third-generation , or 3g , networks .
paget called on telecom providers to switch to 3g networks , saying gsm is broken , but the gsm association , an industry consortium , remains unconcerned . " although it is generally acknowledged that a ‘ man in the middle attack ’ using a false base station is possible , there are a number of hurdles to be overcome to launch a successful attack , " it said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over four billion gsm users worldwide how a fake cell phone tower works cell phones are tricked into routing their outbound calls through the fake cell phone tower , enabling the hacker who controls it to listen in .
paget 's gear can target specific numbers and may even give hackers access to credit card or account information siphoned from calls made to shops and banks .
it 's the price tag that has industry insiders worried .
the system only costs $ 1,500 , or about 1,100 euros , to create , meaning mobile phone hacks are now more broadly available than ever before .
“ these attacks used to cost millions of dollars , now you can do it for a lot less , ” paget told the agence france presse news agency at the conference on saturday .
but the gsm association says having the equipment doesn ’ t immediately provide access to private calls .
they say hackers need to be within a certain range of their victims , and they have to bypass mechanisms designed to protect the identity of mobile users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a switch to 3g may not make phones any safer heavy investment in older technologies other industry watchers say the truth is mobile phone operators and manufacturers are n't prepared to make the switch to better security .
" telecom providers have made a substantial investment and want to use the old technology " said christos xenakis , a mobile security lecturer at the university of piraeus in greece .
he believes the industry never anticipated that hackers would be able to spoof a gsm signal for such little money . " the problem is that when the technology was designed 25 years ago , no one imagined it would become so cheap , ” he said in an interview with deutsche welle . but xenakis says security upgrades are becoming more available . " technology solves this problem , " he said .
" with new generation umts networks , third generation networks , new mobile networks ... there are answers coming . "
xenakis added that the industry will eventually be forced to advance beyond 3g capabilities , as paget showed on saturday how even 3g remains vulnerable .
during his demonstration , paget said he could also capture phones using 3g by sending out jamming noise to block this technology .
the phones then would automatically revert to a 2g connection and connect through his rogue base .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement savage uses family tragedy to help others footballer robbie savage has brought forward the release of his autobiography , concerned his father 's deteriorating health condition means he wo n't soon recognise him .
" it 's shattering to see the man i know , i idolise , like this , " said savage , a bbc football commentator .
" it 's soul destroying . "
the former wales international had planned to write his book at the end of his playing career .
but that view changed over recent years because his father , colin , started to suffer from a form of dementia which becomes worse over time .
" i want him to read about his son , " says robbie who plays for derby county .
" he may not know the name ' robbie savage ' in the future . "
the man who has always been my hero will one day no longer recognise mum , his grandkids and me robbie savage the footballer began playing whilst a schoolboy at ysgol bryn alyn , gwersyllt , wrexham , and his father was a big supporter , becoming manager of robbie 's team , bradley u14s .
colin 's support continued throughout savage 's professional career with him and wife , val , following their son to most games , wherever he was playing .
" he was incredibly loyal , " said savage .
" he had a high powered job and had done really well .
he worked really hard .
his lifestyle was very stressful .
he was flying around the world .
" he 'd get home from somewhere like cuba on a friday night or saturday morning and then drive to where i was playing .
it might even be southampton . "
but things started to change a decade ago .
" he started to lose weight and was n't eating .
something was n't right , " said savage , who has written about his father 's condition in his column in the mirror newspaper .
" it means that eventually the man who has always been my hero will one day no longer recognise mum , his grandkids and me , " wrote savage .
" it is a cruel and devastating illness and 63 is no age to have it . "
savage said his father took early retirement at 57 and , at first , was fine but " he started to lose interest in things " .
savage and his father used to play pool together socially and that was when he started to notice a change in colin 's attitude , his speech and memory would be affected , and he could become rude .
" that was n't my dad , " said savage .
eventually , colin was diagnosed with a form of fronto-temporal dementia called pick 's disease .
it is caused by damage to the frontal lobe and / or the temporal parts of the brain which are responsible for behaviour , emotional responses and language skills , according to the pick 's disease support group .
north wales regional contact colin jones from bangor said , unlike alzheimer 's , pick 's affects younger people , mainly in their 40s and 50s .
" it affects people differently , " he said .
" you have a change in personality , behavioural problems , but different patients have different symptoms .
" you know something is adrift but you do n't know what it is , " he said .
" it is more rare than alzheimer and difficult to diagnose . "
some of the proceeds of the book , savage , which he launches publicly in birmingham on thursday accompanied by his parents , are being donated to the alzheimer 's society .
