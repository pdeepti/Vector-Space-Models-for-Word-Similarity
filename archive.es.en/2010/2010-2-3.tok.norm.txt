program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 03.02.2010 hackers steal emissions trading certificates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions trading is in the focus of fraudsters computer hackers have launched a massive phishing attack on the german emissions trading authority .
reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .

they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .

" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .

phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .

under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's top diplomat says it 's merely a logistical problem summit a priority for spain obama 's decision comes as a blow to the zapatero , who had made the summit a priority of his country 's six months at the helm of the eu 's rotating presidency .
reports said zapatero was not scheduled to meet obama , but may have a chance to speak with him at the annual national prayer breakfast , where the spanish prime minister is to give a bible reading .
the developments are also being seen as a setback to brussels as the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet obama .

appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .

there is no problem .

we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma .

it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .

peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .

germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .

a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .

phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

the reason , he said , was that the man stated in his application he would never allow his wife to leave the home without a full veil and that a woman " is an inferior being . " fillon said the applicant does not respect french values of secularism and equality of the sexes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon 's move is in line with sarkozy 's efforts to challenge the wearing of the burqa " it 's french law .
the civil code has foreseen for a long time that citizenship could be refused to anyone who does not respect the values of the republic , " he said .

however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's top diplomat says it 's merely a logistical problem summit a priority for spain obama 's decision comes as a blow to the zapatero , who had made the summit a priority of his country 's six months at the helm of the eu 's rotating presidency .
reports said zapatero was not scheduled to meet obama , but may have a chance to speak with him at the annual national prayer breakfast , where the spanish prime minister is to give a bible reading .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 03.02.2010 sudanese president bashir may face genocide charge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bashir has lashed out at the international community over the icc 's arrest warrant the international criminal court in the hague ruled wednesday that a possible charge of genocide against sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir should be re-examined . the international criminal court in the hague -lrb- icc -rrb- reversed a decision on wednesday that prosecutors had not provided enough evidence to charge sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir with genocide .
appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 03.02.2010 sudanese president bashir may face genocide charge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bashir has lashed out at the international community over the icc 's arrest warrant the international criminal court in the hague ruled wednesday that a possible charge of genocide against sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir should be re-examined . the international criminal court in the hague -lrb- icc -rrb- reversed a decision on wednesday that prosecutors had not provided enough evidence to charge sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir with genocide .
appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "

robinson , leader of the democratic unionist party , stepped down january 11 after his wife admitted to an affair with a 19-year-old and a bbc documentary made the allegations of financial impropriety .
his wife , also a british parliament member , acknowledged that she had solicited funds to provide the young man with a 50,000 pound -lrb- 57,100 euro , $ 79,600 -rrb- business loan , for which robinson was also accused of being in breach of parliamentary code .
" i have acted at all times properly , and in compliance with my public duties , " robinson said in a statement to afp .
an internal investigation found there had been " no breaches whatsoever " of the ministerial code of conduct , pledge of office or other ethics rules .
robinson is considering legal action over the claims .
though enterprise minister arlene foster stood in as first minister during robinson 's absence , he continued to lead talks on the transfer of police and justice powers to belfast from london .
shaun woodward , britain 's northern ireland minister , said earlier wednesday that " considerable progress " had been made in the talks but admitted they were " on the edge .

beijing warned the swiss government in early january that accepting the inmates , ethnic uighurs and alleged terrorists in china , could sour relations between the two countries . the swiss justice ministry said it was aware of china 's concerns but had decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds , adding that the men did n't represent a security risk .
" today the federal council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two uighurs with chinese citizenship , who have been imprisoned in guantanamo for years by the united states without being charged with a crime nor condemned , " it said .
justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .
in january , an uzbek became the first former guantanamo inmate to be resettled in switzerland .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .

" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .

just the idea is enough to send shivers down the spine of chinese environmentalists .
in 2005 , it took days for the authorities in harbin to ensure that the drinking water supply was safe after a chemical leak into the songhua river .
the government needed 10 days to clean up . this time , a reservoir that provides drinking water for over 440 million people is at stake : the yangtze river - china ’ s biggest and most important river .
it seems to have become a paradise for multinational chemical plants .
but the locals are putting up resistance to german chemicals giant basf .
chongqing , a city on the great yangtze river , is a huge trading hub .
workers cart crates between buildings .
trucks are loaded up on every street corner .
supplies for the whole of western china get shipped out from here .
the chemicals giant basf wants to tap into this booming market with its new plant .
it hopes soon to be supplying foam and insulation material to the entire region .
jaak van steen , a basf manager , explained , " in chongqing and its neighboring provinces there are two to four hundred million people .
it ’ s as big as europe .
it ’ s going to attract a lot of industry and bring added value to the region . "
pollution vs. growth but on the ground , it doesn ’ t look so rosy .
the air in chongqing ’ s chemicals and industry park is so dusty that one can hardly breathe .
in nearby changshou , there is little sign of the big companies bringing wealth .
people sell cheap goods on the streets .
everyone has an opinion about the basf plant .
one man said , " there are advantages and disadvantages .
on the one hand , it could increase our income but the disadvantage is that the environment will be damaged .
and that could damage our health . "
a woman nearby was of the opinion , " of course , we ’ re worried , the economy might be developed but it ’ s bad for our health .
environmental protection standards are not being achieved . "
chinese stamp of approval but whatever the locals think does not seem to be of great importance .
the plans have already been approved by the local authorities and the chinese ministry of environment .
activist wu dengming , however , is determined to keep up the fight .
the former university lecturer is 70 years old .
he founded the green volunteers ’ league in chongqing and has mobilised 10,000 volunteers to protect the yangtze river : " this is not about the interests of any particular region , ethnic group or country .
protecting the environment should be the common interest and goal of everyone , the whole world .
when people do not behave responsibly towards the environment it causes criticism and resistance in developed countries - and in china as well ! "
environmental standards below average he said that basf has to adhere to international standards .
greenpeace has criticised the german company before and said it uses different standards in different countries .
basf ’ s jaak van steen rejected such allegations .
" i have to say that even for this plant that we are building in chongqing the wastewater that we produce in the plant compared to our plants in other parts of the world is 50 percent less - it will be the most modern plant of basf in the world . "
wu doesn ’ t trust van steen and wants an independent citizen ’ s committee to be set up to supervise basf .
he and other critics of the basf plant in chongqing no longer want economic development at the cost of their environment .
that ’ s why their voices are getting louder .
especially on the internet .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "

" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

beijing warned the swiss government in early january that accepting the inmates , ethnic uighurs and alleged terrorists in china , could sour relations between the two countries . the swiss justice ministry said it was aware of china 's concerns but had decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds , adding that the men did n't represent a security risk .
" today the federal council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two uighurs with chinese citizenship , who have been imprisoned in guantanamo for years by the united states without being charged with a crime nor condemned , " it said .
justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .
in january , an uzbek became the first former guantanamo inmate to be resettled in switzerland .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "

" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

the reason , he said , was that the man stated in his application he would never allow his wife to leave the home without a full veil and that a woman " is an inferior being . " fillon said the applicant does not respect french values of secularism and equality of the sexes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon 's move is in line with sarkozy 's efforts to challenge the wearing of the burqa " it 's french law .
the civil code has foreseen for a long time that citizenship could be refused to anyone who does not respect the values of the republic , " he said .
" if this man does not want to change his attitude , he has no place in this country .
in any case , he does not deserve french nationality . " the applicant 's wife is a french citizen , fillon said . france has made similar citizenship decisions in the past .
a veiled moroccan woman was denied citizenship by a french court two years ago because the court claimed her " radical " practice of islam was incompatible with french values . fillon said he made his decision after the council of state , the country 's highest administrative court , said it had no objections to the refusal of citizenship . french debate burqa 's place in france this most recent case comes as france engages in a heated national debate about what it means to be french and whether the burqa has a place in french society . president nicolas sarkozy has said the burqa was " not welcome " in secular france , and last week a parliamentary commission recommended banning burqas in schools , hospitals , government offices and on public transportation .
sarkozy and his government have pushed for some sort of burqa ban . while france is home to the largest muslim population in europe , the country 's interior ministry says only about 1,900 women wear a burqa .
a recent survey found that 57 percent of the french were in favor of a law banning the burqa . hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

read on to see where they come down on the issue . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german decision to buy ' tax evaders ' list angers switzerland of course it is proper .
the government has to have tax money to function .
they will receive much more than they will pay out .
also , it is not fair to those germans who are paying their taxes . - henry hall , canada the decision to buy the tax-evader list is not morally and legally justifiable .
it is not fair on the part of the state to throw its hands up in despair and seek the help of another set of criminals .
the state should not forget that the evaders used the existing laws to stash funds .
the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .
the scope of greece 's debt and its 12.7 percent public deficit have shaken the euro and put pressure on greek sovereign bonds. rb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "

worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

beijing warned the swiss government in early january that accepting the inmates , ethnic uighurs and alleged terrorists in china , could sour relations between the two countries . the swiss justice ministry said it was aware of china 's concerns but had decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds , adding that the men did n't represent a security risk .
" today the federal council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two uighurs with chinese citizenship , who have been imprisoned in guantanamo for years by the united states without being charged with a crime nor condemned , " it said .
justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .
in january , an uzbek became the first former guantanamo inmate to be resettled in switzerland .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "

prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?

spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .

robinson , leader of the democratic unionist party , stepped down january 11 after his wife admitted to an affair with a 19-year-old and a bbc documentary made the allegations of financial impropriety .
his wife , also a british parliament member , acknowledged that she had solicited funds to provide the young man with a 50,000 pound -lrb- 57,100 euro , $ 79,600 -rrb- business loan , for which robinson was also accused of being in breach of parliamentary code .

an internal investigation found there had been " no breaches whatsoever " of the ministerial code of conduct , pledge of office or other ethics rules .
robinson is considering legal action over the claims .
though enterprise minister arlene foster stood in as first minister during robinson 's absence , he continued to lead talks on the transfer of police and justice powers to belfast from london .

the reason , he said , was that the man stated in his application he would never allow his wife to leave the home without a full veil and that a woman " is an inferior being . " fillon said the applicant does not respect french values of secularism and equality of the sexes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon 's move is in line with sarkozy 's efforts to challenge the wearing of the burqa " it 's french law .
the civil code has foreseen for a long time that citizenship could be refused to anyone who does not respect the values of the republic , " he said .
" if this man does not want to change his attitude , he has no place in this country .
in any case , he does not deserve french nationality . " the applicant 's wife is a french citizen , fillon said . france has made similar citizenship decisions in the past .
a veiled moroccan woman was denied citizenship by a french court two years ago because the court claimed her " radical " practice of islam was incompatible with french values . fillon said he made his decision after the council of state , the country 's highest administrative court , said it had no objections to the refusal of citizenship . french debate burqa 's place in france this most recent case comes as france engages in a heated national debate about what it means to be french and whether the burqa has a place in french society . president nicolas sarkozy has said the burqa was " not welcome " in secular france , and last week a parliamentary commission recommended banning burqas in schools , hospitals , government offices and on public transportation .
sarkozy and his government have pushed for some sort of burqa ban . while france is home to the largest muslim population in europe , the country 's interior ministry says only about 1,900 women wear a burqa .
a recent survey found that 57 percent of the french were in favor of a law banning the burqa . hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .

appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german decision to buy ' tax evaders ' list angers switzerland of course it is proper .
the government has to have tax money to function .
they will receive much more than they will pay out .
also , it is not fair to those germans who are paying their taxes . - henry hall , canada the decision to buy the tax-evader list is not morally and legally justifiable .
it is not fair on the part of the state to throw its hands up in despair and seek the help of another set of criminals .
the state should not forget that the evaders used the existing laws to stash funds .
the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.02.2010 eu to monitor money-saving efforts by cash-strapped greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes are already planned to protest the measures the european union has approved a greek government plan to bring its runaway budget deficit under control .
however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

german decision to buy ' tax evaders ' list angers switzerland of course it is proper .
the government has to have tax money to function .
they will receive much more than they will pay out .
also , it is not fair to those germans who are paying their taxes . - henry hall , canada the decision to buy the tax-evader list is not morally and legally justifiable .
it is not fair on the part of the state to throw its hands up in despair and seek the help of another set of criminals .
the state should not forget that the evaders used the existing laws to stash funds .
the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

robinson , leader of the democratic unionist party , stepped down january 11 after his wife admitted to an affair with a 19-year-old and a bbc documentary made the allegations of financial impropriety .
his wife , also a british parliament member , acknowledged that she had solicited funds to provide the young man with a 50,000 pound -lrb- 57,100 euro , $ 79,600 -rrb- business loan , for which robinson was also accused of being in breach of parliamentary code .
" i have acted at all times properly , and in compliance with my public duties , " robinson said in a statement to afp .
an internal investigation found there had been " no breaches whatsoever " of the ministerial code of conduct , pledge of office or other ethics rules .
robinson is considering legal action over the claims .
though enterprise minister arlene foster stood in as first minister during robinson 's absence , he continued to lead talks on the transfer of police and justice powers to belfast from london .
shaun woodward , britain 's northern ireland minister , said earlier wednesday that " considerable progress " had been made in the talks but admitted they were " on the edge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 03.02.2010 sudanese president bashir may face genocide charge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bashir has lashed out at the international community over the icc 's arrest warrant the international criminal court in the hague ruled wednesday that a possible charge of genocide against sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir should be re-examined . the international criminal court in the hague -lrb- icc -rrb- reversed a decision on wednesday that prosecutors had not provided enough evidence to charge sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir with genocide .
appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's top diplomat says it 's merely a logistical problem summit a priority for spain obama 's decision comes as a blow to the zapatero , who had made the summit a priority of his country 's six months at the helm of the eu 's rotating presidency .
reports said zapatero was not scheduled to meet obama , but may have a chance to speak with him at the annual national prayer breakfast , where the spanish prime minister is to give a bible reading .
the developments are also being seen as a setback to brussels as the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet obama .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's top diplomat says it 's merely a logistical problem summit a priority for spain obama 's decision comes as a blow to the zapatero , who had made the summit a priority of his country 's six months at the helm of the eu 's rotating presidency .

beijing warned the swiss government in early january that accepting the inmates , ethnic uighurs and alleged terrorists in china , could sour relations between the two countries . the swiss justice ministry said it was aware of china 's concerns but had decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds , adding that the men did n't represent a security risk .
" today the federal council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two uighurs with chinese citizenship , who have been imprisoned in guantanamo for years by the united states without being charged with a crime nor condemned , " it said .
justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .
in january , an uzbek became the first former guantanamo inmate to be resettled in switzerland .
widmer-schlumpf said the country is not planning to take in any further detainees. cmk / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

the federal criminal police office said wednesday that it was interviewing more than 100 women from different west african countries who were forced to work as prostitutes , some of them minors .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.02.2010 eu to monitor money-saving efforts by cash-strapped greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes are already planned to protest the measures the european union has approved a greek government plan to bring its runaway budget deficit under control .
however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .

however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .

beijing warned the swiss government in early january that accepting the inmates , ethnic uighurs and alleged terrorists in china , could sour relations between the two countries . the swiss justice ministry said it was aware of china 's concerns but had decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds , adding that the men did n't represent a security risk .
" today the federal council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two uighurs with chinese citizenship , who have been imprisoned in guantanamo for years by the united states without being charged with a crime nor condemned , " it said .
justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .
in january , an uzbek became the first former guantanamo inmate to be resettled in switzerland .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .

spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .

the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf said switzerland has a " stable , good relationship with china , and we want to keep it that way . "
in january , a swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the detainees , citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an american airliner on december 25 . the detainees , who are brothers , will be resettled in the canton of jura .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's top diplomat says it 's merely a logistical problem summit a priority for spain obama 's decision comes as a blow to the zapatero , who had made the summit a priority of his country 's six months at the helm of the eu 's rotating presidency .
reports said zapatero was not scheduled to meet obama , but may have a chance to speak with him at the annual national prayer breakfast , where the spanish prime minister is to give a bible reading .
the developments are also being seen as a setback to brussels as the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet obama .

however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .

it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .

the federal criminal police office said wednesday that it was interviewing more than 100 women from different west african countries who were forced to work as prostitutes , some of them minors .
tuesday 's raids follow an investigation of several years into what police believe is a wide-ranging network of human smugglers , pimps and money launderers .
the women , lured to europe with promises of a better life , were often up to 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 98,000 -rrb- in debt to the human traffickers .
" only if we manage to win the trust of victims and persuade them to cooperate with the authorities can we break the cycle of repression , intimidation and dependency , " said federal police chief joerg ziercke in wiesbaden .
authorities have so far learned that the network , involved in prostitution , human trafficking , and document forgery , among other illegal activities , is likely active in germany and other european countries. cmk / dpa / apn / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .
world powers were expected to meet soon to discuss possible new sanctions against tehran regarding its nuclear program . dfm / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.02.2010 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not been plain sailing for germany 's governing coalition expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .

however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .

" i have to say that even for this plant that we are building in chongqing the wastewater that we produce in the plant compared to our plants in other parts of the world is 50 percent less - it will be the most modern plant of basf in the world . "
wu doesn ’ t trust van steen and wants an independent citizen ’ s committee to be set up to supervise basf .

when people do not behave responsibly towards the environment it causes criticism and resistance in developed countries - and in china as well ! "
environmental standards below average he said that basf has to adhere to international standards .
greenpeace has criticised the german company before and said it uses different standards in different countries .
basf ’ s jaak van steen rejected such allegations .
" i have to say that even for this plant that we are building in chongqing the wastewater that we produce in the plant compared to our plants in other parts of the world is 50 percent less - it will be the most modern plant of basf in the world . "
wu doesn ’ t trust van steen and wants an independent citizen ’ s committee to be set up to supervise basf .
he and other critics of the basf plant in chongqing no longer want economic development at the cost of their environment .
that ’ s why their voices are getting louder .
especially on the internet .

the federal criminal police office said wednesday that it was interviewing more than 100 women from different west african countries who were forced to work as prostitutes , some of them minors .
tuesday 's raids follow an investigation of several years into what police believe is a wide-ranging network of human smugglers , pimps and money launderers .
the women , lured to europe with promises of a better life , were often up to 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 98,000 -rrb- in debt to the human traffickers .
" only if we manage to win the trust of victims and persuade them to cooperate with the authorities can we break the cycle of repression , intimidation and dependency , " said federal police chief joerg ziercke in wiesbaden .
authorities have so far learned that the network , involved in prostitution , human trafficking , and document forgery , among other illegal activities , is likely active in germany and other european countries. cmk / dpa / apn / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.02.2010 eu to monitor money-saving efforts by cash-strapped greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes are already planned to protest the measures the european union has approved a greek government plan to bring its runaway budget deficit under control .
however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

read on to see where they come down on the issue . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german decision to buy ' tax evaders ' list angers switzerland of course it is proper .
the government has to have tax money to function .
they will receive much more than they will pay out .
also , it is not fair to those germans who are paying their taxes . - henry hall , canada the decision to buy the tax-evader list is not morally and legally justifiable .
it is not fair on the part of the state to throw its hands up in despair and seek the help of another set of criminals .
the state should not forget that the evaders used the existing laws to stash funds .
the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 03.02.2010 nuclear powerbrokers skeptical about iranian proposal on uranium großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has offered a glimmer of hope to the international community the international community has reacted positively to signs iran may accept a un-drafted deal to send its uranium abroad .
but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .

ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.02.2010 eu to monitor money-saving efforts by cash-strapped greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes are already planned to protest the measures the european union has approved a greek government plan to bring its runaway budget deficit under control .
however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

the reason , he said , was that the man stated in his application he would never allow his wife to leave the home without a full veil and that a woman " is an inferior being . " fillon said the applicant does not respect french values of secularism and equality of the sexes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon 's move is in line with sarkozy 's efforts to challenge the wearing of the burqa " it 's french law .
the civil code has foreseen for a long time that citizenship could be refused to anyone who does not respect the values of the republic , " he said .
" if this man does not want to change his attitude , he has no place in this country .
in any case , he does not deserve french nationality . " the applicant 's wife is a french citizen , fillon said . france has made similar citizenship decisions in the past .
a veiled moroccan woman was denied citizenship by a french court two years ago because the court claimed her " radical " practice of islam was incompatible with french values . fillon said he made his decision after the council of state , the country 's highest administrative court , said it had no objections to the refusal of citizenship . french debate burqa 's place in france this most recent case comes as france engages in a heated national debate about what it means to be french and whether the burqa has a place in french society . president nicolas sarkozy has said the burqa was " not welcome " in secular france , and last week a parliamentary commission recommended banning burqas in schools , hospitals , government offices and on public transportation .
sarkozy and his government have pushed for some sort of burqa ban . while france is home to the largest muslim population in europe , the country 's interior ministry says only about 1,900 women wear a burqa .
a recent survey found that 57 percent of the french were in favor of a law banning the burqa . hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

read on to see where they come down on the issue . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german decision to buy ' tax evaders ' list angers switzerland of course it is proper .
the government has to have tax money to function .
they will receive much more than they will pay out .
also , it is not fair to those germans who are paying their taxes . - henry hall , canada the decision to buy the tax-evader list is not morally and legally justifiable .
it is not fair on the part of the state to throw its hands up in despair and seek the help of another set of criminals .
the state should not forget that the evaders used the existing laws to stash funds .
the state is duty-bound to plug loopholes that encouraged stashing money in foreign banks .
further , the informants will now be able to double-cross for their own benefit .
deutschland should live up to its reputation to uphold the rule of law . - ramesh hr , india the german government must strictly abstain from doing business with criminals who have stolen information .
the ends do not justify the means .
it will be shameful for germany to pay for stolen information .
we all believe that good sense and straightness will prevail in the german cabinet . - joao , belgium i do n't think the swiss have ever felt any moral dilemma over providing a safe haven for money amassed by criminals , so who are they to criticize germany .
it is a common practice in many countries to pay informants who are often criminals themselves , as they are the ones who have access to information needed by the police .
this is no different and no more immoral . - diane nicholl , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss lawmakers are unhappy about the data theft in my opinion germany should go ahead as this could infuse millions of euros into the economy .
as far as banking security is concerned , national governments should at least have a scanning system that could pop up every transaction which demands suspicion . - subrata ashe , india it may not be morally correct , but i think it will be useful in bringing down the swiss secrecy laws .
in a way it 's like a war - not moral , but sometimes necessary to end a larger injustice . - jim bryant , us citizens should applaud the german government 's decision to acquire data on tax evaders who enjoy citizens ' benefits in a great country at the expense of " other " taxpayers .
swiss authorities reduce themselves to the ludicrous when they bray about the " rule of law , " when they encourage criminals from another country purely because it is profitable to swiss banking and investment interests .
that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu-us annual summits are seen as a symbol of their ' strategic relationship ' " obviously , there 's been some disappointment expressed by the government of spain , and we understand that and ... we 'll be working with them on that , " state department spokesman philip crowley told reporters .
the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "
" i knew about the possibility that president obama would not be able to make that date , " she said , adding that the white house was " looking for another date " for the summit .

reports said zapatero was not scheduled to meet obama , but may have a chance to speak with him at the annual national prayer breakfast , where the spanish prime minister is to give a bible reading .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

the federal criminal police office said wednesday that it was interviewing more than 100 women from different west african countries who were forced to work as prostitutes , some of them minors .
tuesday 's raids follow an investigation of several years into what police believe is a wide-ranging network of human smugglers , pimps and money launderers .
the women , lured to europe with promises of a better life , were often up to 70,000 euros -lrb- $ 98,000 -rrb- in debt to the human traffickers .
" only if we manage to win the trust of victims and persuade them to cooperate with the authorities can we break the cycle of repression , intimidation and dependency , " said federal police chief joerg ziercke in wiesbaden .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .
journalist dennis telefakotos says that papandreou secured the support of the conservative and right-wing opposition parties , but the far left - which has the support of roughly one in 10 greeks - refused .
european scapegoat ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's total national debt could reach 120 percent of gdp this year while greece is the european union 's biggest economic problem child , it is by no means alone in spending more than brussels would advise during the recent recession .
spain 's 2009 deficit , for example , weighed in at 11.4 percent of gross domestic product , with countries like portugal , ireland , france and even germany also exceeding the three-percent target , often by considerable margins .
" greece was , i would say , the perfect victim , " said telelfakotos , when asked if his country had become a euro-zone scapegoat , a way for brussels to send a warning signal to other indebted member states .
" the 12.7-percent deficit ; the fact that it is a small country ; the fact that it is a socialist government in a sea of right-wing governments in europe .
it was the perfect case-study . "
the euro 's value has been steadily falling against the dollar in recent weeks , with budget woes and fears that countries like greece might have to default on their debt fuelling the phenomenon .
however , economists are divided as to whether that currency devaluation is good or bad for european economies .

the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

robinson , leader of the democratic unionist party , stepped down january 11 after his wife admitted to an affair with a 19-year-old and a bbc documentary made the allegations of financial impropriety .
his wife , also a british parliament member , acknowledged that she had solicited funds to provide the young man with a 50,000 pound -lrb- 57,100 euro , $ 79,600 -rrb- business loan , for which robinson was also accused of being in breach of parliamentary code .
" i have acted at all times properly , and in compliance with my public duties , " robinson said in a statement to afp .
an internal investigation found there had been " no breaches whatsoever " of the ministerial code of conduct , pledge of office or other ethics rules .
robinson is considering legal action over the claims .
though enterprise minister arlene foster stood in as first minister during robinson 's absence , he continued to lead talks on the transfer of police and justice powers to belfast from london .

but several governments stressed tehran must still partake in international talks over the matter . governments involved in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have reacted cautiously to comments by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has said it would be " no problem " for his country to accept a un-sponsored deal to have iranian uranium purified abroad .
german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday ahmadinejad ’ s comments would be worthless unless they were followed by concrete measures .
" we have to see whether iran actually takes up the offer to enrich uranium abroad , " she said at a news conference .
" one speech does not necessarily mean it will take further steps . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle echoed merkel ’ s comments , telling n-24 television that " if that does n't happen and it 's all just tactics , the international community will agree on further measures .
then sanctions can not be ruled out . "
ahmadinejad had told iranian television it would be iran could send out its stocks of low-enriched uranium to another country for it to be turned into reactor fuel and returned to iran , as per a un-sponsored deal formulated late last year . international skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is pushing ahead with its nuclear program while the comments have been seen as a positive signal that iran could be willing to engage with the international community over its nuclear program , some governments expressed uncertainty over tehran 's intentions . french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he was " perplexed and even a bit pessimistic " about ahmadinejad 's comments , reported news agency ap .
he added that the iranian government was " trying to buy time " by making such an offer . britain , meanwhile , said it would be a " positive sign " if iran was willing to take up the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- offer to enrich its uranium abroad but said that international talks were still key to solving the dilemma . " that remains the crucial issue in terms of addressing serious international concern about their nuclear program , " the british foreign office said in a statement on its website . the united states said iran should submit a formal offer of the deal to international authorities . " if mr. ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated iranian position , we look forward to iran informing the iaea , " white house official mike hammer said . nuclear intentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea has had a hard time dealing with tehran the west suspects iran of striving to develop nuclear weapons , which tehran has systematically denied .
it insists its nuclear program is peaceful and serves only to generate electricity . iran has been involved in a long-standing tussle with the iaea and the un security council over its uranium enrichment program .
a proposal drawn up by the iaea after talks between iran , france , russia and the us in october last year would see iran sending its low-enriched uranium to russia for further enrichment .
russia would then subcontract france to turn the enriched uranium into fuel rods for a research reactor in tehran . despite initially welcoming the deal , the iranian government has since offered resistance to it .
ahmadinejad ’ s comments on iranian television were the first sign tehran was prepared to accept the iaea offer . " there is really no problem .
some made a fuss for nothing .
there is no problem .
we sign a contract .
we give them 3.5 percent -lsb- enriched uranium -rsb- and it will take four or five months for them to give us the 20 percent , " ahmadinejad said . the comments followed the expiration of a january 31 deadline for the west to accept iranian conditions for a nuclear fuel swap .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "
in the past , greece has submitted incorrect financial data to the eu , though it 's unclear whether the national government or regional administrations are to blame for the irregularities .
prime minister 's appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george papandreou says greece must save money or face disaster the socialist government 's austerity plan includes a freeze of public sector employment , a 10-percent reduction in public sector wages , a tax hike on fuel at the petrol pumps , and changes to the retirement age and tax policies .
" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .

however , brussels will monitor the progress and is reserving the right to call for further measures . the european union on wednesday endorsed a greek plan to bring its national budget deficit back within the prescribed euro-zone limit of three percent of gross domestic product by 2012 .
in 2009 , greece 's deficit was more than four times over that limit , at 12.7 percent .
" we share the ambition of the program , " said the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia in brussels .
" we consider that the program is ambitious , but also we consider that the program , in terms of objectives … and targets , is achievable . "
however , in an unprecedented move , the european union has reserved the right to monitor greece 's progress tackling its excessive public spending and to call for more drastic measures if the current plan fails to meet its targets .
" if the program that has been presented is followed by commitments , by decisions , by actions to resolve the big imbalances of the public finances , of the economy , this will have a positive effect on the markets , " almunia said .
" if decisions are not there , regardless -lsb- of -rsb- who said what , the markets will be put -lsb- under -rsb- additional pressure . "

" the public sector has the problem , not the private sector , " the managing editor of the greek business daily naftemporiki , dennis telefakotos , told deutsche welle .
" the private sector works fine , the banks work fine .
if the state budget was alright , the greeks would have had no problems , even in the depths of the economic crisis . "
however , with strong trade unions and a far-left party already planning strikes and protests against the new plan , the government is walking a tightrope .
" the austerity plan does n't really go far enough , " said martin knapp , director of the greco-german chamber of commerce .
" further measures will probably be necessary , and the greek prime minister said as much on tuesday night , when addressing the population . "
prime minister george papandreou , after holding an emergency meeting with opposition leaders to appeal for their help with the plan , appeared on national television , telling the people they would have to suffer in the short term in order to avoid long-term financial ruin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 03.02.2010 chinese concerns over german chemical plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basf already operates a large plant in nanjing a massive new chemicals plant - right next to a river ?
just the idea is enough to send shivers down the spine of chinese environmentalists .
in 2005 , it took days for the authorities in harbin to ensure that the drinking water supply was safe after a chemical leak into the songhua river .
the government needed 10 days to clean up . this time , a reservoir that provides drinking water for over 440 million people is at stake : the yangtze river - china ’ s biggest and most important river .
it seems to have become a paradise for multinational chemical plants .
but the locals are putting up resistance to german chemicals giant basf .
chongqing , a city on the great yangtze river , is a huge trading hub .
workers cart crates between buildings .
trucks are loaded up on every street corner .
supplies for the whole of western china get shipped out from here .
the chemicals giant basf wants to tap into this booming market with its new plant .
it hopes soon to be supplying foam and insulation material to the entire region .
jaak van steen , a basf manager , explained , " in chongqing and its neighboring provinces there are two to four hundred million people .
it ’ s as big as europe .
it ’ s going to attract a lot of industry and bring added value to the region . "
pollution vs. growth but on the ground , it doesn ’ t look so rosy .
the air in chongqing ’ s chemicals and industry park is so dusty that one can hardly breathe .
in nearby changshou , there is little sign of the big companies bringing wealth .
people sell cheap goods on the streets .
everyone has an opinion about the basf plant .
one man said , " there are advantages and disadvantages .
on the one hand , it could increase our income but the disadvantage is that the environment will be damaged .
and that could damage our health . "
a woman nearby was of the opinion , " of course , we ’ re worried , the economy might be developed but it ’ s bad for our health .
environmental protection standards are not being achieved . "
chinese stamp of approval but whatever the locals think does not seem to be of great importance .
the plans have already been approved by the local authorities and the chinese ministry of environment .
activist wu dengming , however , is determined to keep up the fight .
the former university lecturer is 70 years old .
he founded the green volunteers ’ league in chongqing and has mobilised 10,000 volunteers to protect the yangtze river : " this is not about the interests of any particular region , ethnic group or country .
protecting the environment should be the common interest and goal of everyone , the whole world .
when people do not behave responsibly towards the environment it causes criticism and resistance in developed countries - and in china as well ! "
environmental standards below average he said that basf has to adhere to international standards .
greenpeace has criticised the german company before and said it uses different standards in different countries .
basf ’ s jaak van steen rejected such allegations .
" i have to say that even for this plant that we are building in chongqing the wastewater that we produce in the plant compared to our plants in other parts of the world is 50 percent less - it will be the most modern plant of basf in the world . "
wu doesn ’ t trust van steen and wants an independent citizen ’ s committee to be set up to supervise basf .
he and other critics of the basf plant in chongqing no longer want economic development at the cost of their environment .
that ’ s why their voices are getting louder .
especially on the internet .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

it has also launched infringement proceedings against greece . the european commission said on wednesday it had endorsed greek plans to cut the country 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by the end of 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009 .
however , the european union 's executive arm said athens must take further steps to cut public sector wages and put finances in order .
" greece has adopted an ambitious program to correct its fiscal imbalances and to reform its economy , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said in brussels .
however , the commission said in a statement that " considering that greece has failed in its duty to report reliable budgetary statistics ... the commission is also initiating infringement proceedings . "
it recommended that greece adopt a " comprehensive structural reform package aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and healthcare reform , improving labor market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system . "
in an assessment closely watched by financial markets weighing up greece 's credibility as a debtor , the commission also said athens must submit an interim report on its deficit reduction progress by mid-march .
it also told athens to set aside 10 percent of current expenditure to create a contingency reserve in case of future budgetary pressures .
late on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou ordered a public salary freeze , a higher retirement age and a hike in petrol prices in a desperate bid to tame a debt crisis ahead of the eu verdict .
the socialist leader urged political rivals to back his crisis budget as he launched a new bid to reassure the international finance community .

reports in germany claim the hackers reaped millions of euros in fraudulent emissions trading certificates . the european trade in co2 emissions permits has been brought to a virtual standstill after computer hackers cracked security codes to gain access to company accounts last week .
the financial times deutschland reported on wednesday that the hackers launched a so-called " phishing attack " in which they asked companies involved in the emissions trading scheme to re-register with the german emissions trading authority -lrb- dehst -rrb- .
companies which did so , the newspaper wrote , suffered huge losses as the hackers stole and then sold their carbon permits on the european emissions market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon trading has become big international business under the emissions trading scheme , also known as cap and trade , companies are required to buy permits in order to emit co2 and other greenhouse gases .
companies that need to increase their emission allowance must buy credits from those who pollute less .
phishing for profit according to the financial times deutschland , the fraudsters sent e-mails to companies in several european countries , as well as in japan and new zealand .
they used the official dehst logo , and urged the companies in the mails to register again as a hacker attack was allegedly imminent .
the hackers were thus able to gain access to company accounts and transferred their emission certificates to accounts registered in denmark and great britain .
from there they sold the co2 emission permits on the free market for a thus far undisclosed sum of money .
one medium-sized company in germany , for instance , reportedly lost permits worth 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2.1million -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dehst described the attack as “ highly professional , ” and said that the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- was investigating the incident .
" access to the german database to register emission deals would be barred for at least the rest of this week , " the dehst spokesperson added .
co2 trade prone to fraud in august last year , the emissions trading scheme was already in the focus of german tax investigators after it was revealed that fraudulent deals cheated the state out of hundreds of millions of euros in taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies investing in eco-friendly technologies profit from co2 trade the fraud was based on carousel transactions in which dealers took advantage of the fact that trade within the eu are exempt from sales taxes .
under the 2005 kyoto climate protocol , a global trade in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions is to be established as a way to reduce harmful emissions .
current prices for co2 certificates are set on exchanges , such as the ecx in london or the eex in the german town of leipzig .
according to the norwegian market watchdog , point carbon , more than 8 million tons of co2 emissions worth 94 billion euros were traded in europe last year. uh / ap / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's as bad as giving thieves and other burglars asylum or immigration rights .
well done , deutschland ! - dr. jack w , us could n't the german government just use its own agents and specialists to obtain the data in the same manner as the person trying to sell the info ? - juergen , us if nations can use spying to protect their country , why not get the info and at least stay vigilant for tax evaders and in time take proper action .
i feel there is no ethics problem in catching traitors .
if the swiss can protect unethical data , why ca n't others hunt for it to serve their own country ? - arvind gupta , india rather than participate in the transfer of stolen information , the german government should do the following : 1 .
turn the thief over to the swiss government for prosecution .
2 .
get the swiss to stop providing a tax haven and provide the german government the necessary information as part of the normal processes of the banks .
3 .
prosecute the german tax evaders after a grace period to permit voluntary compliance without penalty . - strohmann , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since . germany 's federal elections in september provided contrasting fortunes for the two parties that went on to form the new government .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- achieved their best ever result in a national election - 14.6 percent of voters chose the business-friendly party .
while chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the csu , only managed to get 33.8 percent , a historic low .
a coalition partner was needed and the fdp was not only raring to go , but also the christian democrats ' partner of choice .
a hundred days on , voters ' enthusiasm has waned somewhat , as regional elections in north rhine-westphalia loom , and the coalition partners struggle to find common ground .
crucial regional elections north rhine-westphalia is germany 's most populous state , so the elections there on may 9 are seen as major test for the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the free democrats are anxious to push through their agenda perhaps most pressing on the political agenda is how to deliver tax reform without increasing government spending too much .
the free democrats are keen to make good on the campaign promise of substantial tax breaks .
but germany 's finance minister , christian democrat wolfgang schaeuble , has stressed fiscal discipline must be a priority .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the budget deficit to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year , 2 percent above the limit set by the eu .
" there 's one central problem that has n't really been addressed , " nils diederich , professor for political science at the free university in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the free democrats want major tax breaks and tax reform .
but on the other hand , more spending is needed to tackle the economic crisis .
no one has come up with a plan to solve this problem without jeopardizing an already bloated budget deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1 million german workers work subsidized shorter working hours measures such as a government-subsidized program that allows firms to shorten the working week have helped keep unemployment at bay for now .
worried voters shorter working hours were introduced last year to allow companies to safeguard jobs and retain talented employees .
the state-funded institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- estimates that the measure saved 1.2 million jobs last year .
but voters are unhappy with the government , according to the latest poll by the emnid institute . several cabinet ministers received negative approval ratings , particularly those representing the fdp .
only 21 percent of those polled believe that fdp economy minister rainer bruederle is doing a good job , while fdp health minister philipp roesler was rated good by only 31 percent .
only 61 percent believe that merkel is doing a good job , while 34 percent disapproved of her leadership .
the most popular cabinet minister is defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , whose approval rating was at 65 percent .
" the biggest problem for germans is the state of the country 's finances , " says klaus-peter schoeppner , managing director at emnid .
" voters are afraid of going backwards , of not being able to afford as much as before .
it 's the first time they 've had to deal with the effects of globalization and a high budget deficit .
that makes germans insecure , " schoeppner told deutsche welle .
the war in afghanistan is another thorny issue .
peace-loving germans are not in favor of the bundeswehr 's mission there .
but most political parties agree that leaving afghanistan to fend for itself at this point would be foolish .
a new afghanistan strategy after weeks of wrangling between foreign minister guido westerwelle of the fdp and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- , the government presented a united front at the afghanistan conference in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to focus on training afghan police officers chancellor angela merkel has promised nato 500 extra troops , plus a reserve unit of 350 soldiers .
but the increase is aimed at boosting training and civilian protection rather than combat activity .
germany currently has around 4,300 troops in afghanistan .
guttenberg had hoped for at least 2,000 extra troops , as requested by washington , but merkel was keen to stress the importance of the new strategy .
" regarding our soldiers in the north of afghanistan , we will create training and protection units responsible for the training of the afghan police force through 2011 , " she said in january .
" our new strategy is to focus on civilian protection and training , it 's a much more defensive approach and we will rearrange our troops to accommodate this . "
health issues meanwhile , health minister philipp roesler , a free demcrat , is at loggerheads with the influential csu premier of the state of bavaria , horst seehofer , over how to reform the ailing german health service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health insurers are trying to plug a huge hole in their budget the german association of health insurers -lrb- gkv -rrb- expects a combined deficit of 7.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.8 billion -rrb- for its members in 2010 .
rising costs for treatments mean the government is looking for ways to improve the system .
roesler is determined to introduce a flat rate for healthcare contributions , meaning that everybody pays the same amount .
those who can not afford the payment would get a state subsidy .
" i think it 's clear to everybody that we need a change in health policy , " roesler told german television last week .
" we have to do better , and when we present our concept i 'm convinced that i can persuade my colleagues in the cdu and csu of my plans . "
seehofer , who is the head of the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , is among those who have dismissed the plans as unworkable , not least because a large part of the population would not be able to pay their share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 03.02.2010 sudanese president bashir may face genocide charge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bashir has lashed out at the international community over the icc 's arrest warrant the international criminal court in the hague ruled wednesday that a possible charge of genocide against sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir should be re-examined . the international criminal court in the hague -lrb- icc -rrb- reversed a decision on wednesday that prosecutors had not provided enough evidence to charge sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir with genocide .
appeals judges ruled that the icc 's pre-trial chamber must re-examine whether the president should be charged with the crime .
he already faces seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes , including murder , extermination , torture and rape . " it was a legal error to reject the genocide charges against president al-bashir , " said prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in a press statement .
moreno-ocampo said he intended to present new evidence to the court in a second bid to have bashir charged with genocide , warning that the president needed to " get a lawyer . "
" expelling humanitarian assistance is a great element of his genocidal intentions , " moreno-ocampo told reuters .
legal observers said wednesday 's decision brought the prospect of a charge of genocide a step closer , though the ruling to add genocide to the list could take months .
bashir : ' all lies ' sudanese officials objected to the ruling .
" this procedure of the icc is only to stop the efforts of the sudanese government towards elections and a peaceful exchange of power , " rabie abdelati , a senior information ministry official , told reuters in khartoum .
the icc issued an arrest warrant for president bashir , the first ever issued against a sitting head of state , in march 2009 for war crimes in darfur .
at the time , the court said there were insufficient grounds to issue a warrant for genocide .
bashir described the icc warrant against him as " all lies " last year and responded by ordering foreign aid agencies out of sudan .
relations between the international community and the sudanese president and his allies have since deteriorated .
estimates vary widely on how many people have died in the darfur conflict , which began when mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
the united nations says more than 300,000 have died and 2.5 million displaced by the conflict .
the sudanese government claims only around 10,000 have died .
the icc 's ruling comes as sudan is preparing for its first democratic presidential election in 24 years , scheduled to start april 11 .
desperate to legitimize himself in the wake of the icc warrant , bashir has pursued alliances with three other leading parties .
observers say support from any one of these parties would likely return bashir to the presidential palace. cmk / rb / reuters / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington amid speculation that a key us-eu summit planned for may could be postponed thanks to president obama 's decision to skip it . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero arrives in washington on wednesday for a two-day visit to the us in the wake of the announcement that president barack obama would not participate in the annual eu-us summit .
spain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , is scheduled to host the summit with us and eu leaders on may 24-25 .
the united states said on tuesday that it was in touch with the spanish government after it voiced disappointment over obama 's decision to skip the madrid summit .

the white house announced on monday that obama would not travel to the summit in the spanish capital after a year of frenzied travel .
us presidential aides pointed out that obama traveled to europe no fewer than six times last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit .
some reports suggest that obama ’ s decision not to come to the summit owes partly to the upheaval caused by the lisbon treaty which came into effect on december 1 .
the treaty has reportedly triggered confusion over who the us president should meet as it created the key posts of eu council president and foreign policy chief .
decision not a ‘ snub ' however , the eu 's top diplomat has rejected suggestions that obama 's decision not to attend an eu-us summit was a snub , saying a new date in november was already being considered .
catherine ashton , the bloc 's foreign policy chief , described it as no more than " a logistical problem . "

figures suggest that more than a million people will have developed the disease before 2025 .
the government has published a dementia strategy and appointed a dementia " tsar " to oversee services .
but campaigners still say there needs to be greater commitment to tackling a condition for which there is no effective treatment .
what is dementia ?
the idea that mental faculties can deteriorate with age has been recognised for centuries .
some researchers even believe that shakespeare 's king lear was a study of dementia .
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
there are many types , but alzheimer 's disease , which accounts for two thirds of cases , is the most well-known .
it is named after the german scientist alois alzheimer who identified the condition over a century ago .
alois alzheimer identified the disease that bears his name 100 years ago .
alzheimer had studied a patient at the frankfurt asylum called auguste deter .
he first saw her in 1901 and followed her case until her death in 1906 .
she displayed short-term memory loss and disorientation and , after her death , an examination of her brain showed she had the tell-tale protein deposits of amyloid plaques and tau tangles which characterise alzheimer 's disease .
another form of the condition is vascular dementia , which develops when the oxygen supply fails and brain cells die .
lewy body dementia occurs when small structures develop in nerve cells , causing the degeneration of brain tissue .
fronto-temporal dementia affects personality and behaviour more than memory .
all forms of dementia are progressive : as the brain becomes increasingly damaged over time , so a person 's symptoms will become worse .
although the elderly are primary victims of the disease - about a third of people over 65 die with a form of it - it also affects about 15,000 people under the age of 65 .
how it is diagnosed the only truly accurate way to know whether person has alzheimer 's is to analyse their brain in a postmortem .
trying to diagnose the condition when someone is alive can be difficult because so many of the signs are initially subtle , or shared with other illnesses .
symptoms memory problems poor judgement difficulties with everyday tasks language problems changes in mood , behaviour and personality signs of confusion , agitation or forgetfulness are what usually first prompt a visit to the gp .
it can take weeks - or months if someone is in the early stages of the disease - to receive a clinical diagnosis .
this is because the patient needs to be monitored and tested over time to confirm it is dementia rather than another condition , such as depression or a brain tumour .
signs of alzheimer 's disease normal brain alzheimer 's normal brain alzheimer 's orange and red areas on spect scans show areas of highest blood flow and high brain activity blue areas , more evident in alzheimer 's cases , show areas of decreased flow because of decreased brain activity .
reduced blood flow is seen as a result of the death of cells which occurs in alzheimer 's disease .
treatment dementia can not be cured , although there are ways of alleviating symptoms , including psychological help , art or music therapy .
numbers 821,884 people have dementia in the uk 15,000 of those are under 65 the total affected is estimated to reach 1m by 2021 by 2051 , it could reach 1.7m women account for two-thirds of cases dementia currently costs the uk £ 23bn a year but most attention is paid to the role three drugs can play .
these drugs , called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , are better known as aricept , exelon and reminyl .
these prevent an enzyme in the brain which aids communication between nerve cells from breaking down - which in turn may improve or stabilise the symptoms of the disease .
a controversial ruling by the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- stated that these drugs should only be available when alzheimer 's has progressed to its moderate stages , even though it is licensed for people in the earlier stages of the disease .
a further drug , ebixa , which blocks a chemical known to be released in significant quantities in those with alzheimer 's , has also been licensed for use in moderate-to-severe cases in the uk , but it is not routinely available on the nhs .
the plan a government strategy published last year set out a number of measures to improve dementia services in england , including better training for gps and health professionals to help them diagnose people with dementia , and extending the existing network of memory clinics .
these are to act as " hubs " , where people can be referred if they are suspected of having dementia .
the plan is expected to cost nearly £ 2bn over 10 years .
but an official review by the national audit office has raised questions about how the strategy is being delivered , highlighting a number of concerns - from a failure to formally make the condition a national priority in the nhs operating framework to a lack of basic training for healthcare professionals .
it also described joint working with social care as " very patchy " , leading to people with dementia being unnecessarily admitted to hospital , and going into residential care prematurely .
campaigners say the strategy does indeed have the potential to transform lives , but only if local health authorities are forced to give dementia priority .
the government insists implementation is on track , and in january 2010 appointed a dementia " tsar " to oversee the strategy .
scotland has set out its own priorities for dementia care , while wales is due to set out its dementia action plan later this year .
a northern ireland dementia strategy is currently being developed and is expected to be released for consultation in coming months .

figures suggest that more than a million people will have developed the disease before 2025 .
the government has published a dementia strategy and appointed a dementia " tsar " to oversee services .
but campaigners still say there needs to be greater commitment to tackling a condition for which there is no effective treatment .
what is dementia ?
the idea that mental faculties can deteriorate with age has been recognised for centuries .
some researchers even believe that shakespeare 's king lear was a study of dementia .
dementia is an umbrella term which describes a serious deterioration in mental functions , such as memory , language , orientation and judgement .
there are many types , but alzheimer 's disease , which accounts for two thirds of cases , is the most well-known .
it is named after the german scientist alois alzheimer who identified the condition over a century ago .
alois alzheimer identified the disease that bears his name 100 years ago .
alzheimer had studied a patient at the frankfurt asylum called auguste deter .
he first saw her in 1901 and followed her case until her death in 1906 .
she displayed short-term memory loss and disorientation and , after her death , an examination of her brain showed she had the tell-tale protein deposits of amyloid plaques and tau tangles which characterise alzheimer 's disease .
another form of the condition is vascular dementia , which develops when the oxygen supply fails and brain cells die .
lewy body dementia occurs when small structures develop in nerve cells , causing the degeneration of brain tissue .
fronto-temporal dementia affects personality and behaviour more than memory .
all forms of dementia are progressive : as the brain becomes increasingly damaged over time , so a person 's symptoms will become worse .
although the elderly are primary victims of the disease - about a third of people over 65 die with a form of it - it also affects about 15,000 people under the age of 65 .
how it is diagnosed the only truly accurate way to know whether person has alzheimer 's is to analyse their brain in a postmortem .
trying to diagnose the condition when someone is alive can be difficult because so many of the signs are initially subtle , or shared with other illnesses .
symptoms memory problems poor judgement difficulties with everyday tasks language problems changes in mood , behaviour and personality signs of confusion , agitation or forgetfulness are what usually first prompt a visit to the gp .
it can take weeks - or months if someone is in the early stages of the disease - to receive a clinical diagnosis .
this is because the patient needs to be monitored and tested over time to confirm it is dementia rather than another condition , such as depression or a brain tumour .
signs of alzheimer 's disease normal brain alzheimer 's normal brain alzheimer 's orange and red areas on spect scans show areas of highest blood flow and high brain activity blue areas , more evident in alzheimer 's cases , show areas of decreased flow because of decreased brain activity .
reduced blood flow is seen as a result of the death of cells which occurs in alzheimer 's disease .
treatment dementia can not be cured , although there are ways of alleviating symptoms , including psychological help , art or music therapy .
numbers 821,884 people have dementia in the uk 15,000 of those are under 65 the total affected is estimated to reach 1m by 2021 by 2051 , it could reach 1.7m women account for two-thirds of cases dementia currently costs the uk £ 23bn a year but most attention is paid to the role three drugs can play .
these drugs , called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , are better known as aricept , exelon and reminyl .
these prevent an enzyme in the brain which aids communication between nerve cells from breaking down - which in turn may improve or stabilise the symptoms of the disease .
a controversial ruling by the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- stated that these drugs should only be available when alzheimer 's has progressed to its moderate stages , even though it is licensed for people in the earlier stages of the disease .
a further drug , ebixa , which blocks a chemical known to be released in significant quantities in those with alzheimer 's , has also been licensed for use in moderate-to-severe cases in the uk , but it is not routinely available on the nhs .
the plan a government strategy published last year set out a number of measures to improve dementia services in england , including better training for gps and health professionals to help them diagnose people with dementia , and extending the existing network of memory clinics .
these are to act as " hubs " , where people can be referred if they are suspected of having dementia .
the plan is expected to cost nearly £ 2bn over 10 years .
but an official review by the national audit office has raised questions about how the strategy is being delivered , highlighting a number of concerns - from a failure to formally make the condition a national priority in the nhs operating framework to a lack of basic training for healthcare professionals .
it also described joint working with social care as " very patchy " , leading to people with dementia being unnecessarily admitted to hospital , and going into residential care prematurely .
campaigners say the strategy does indeed have the potential to transform lives , but only if local health authorities are forced to give dementia priority .
the government insists implementation is on track , and in january 2010 appointed a dementia " tsar " to oversee the strategy .
scotland has set out its own priorities for dementia care , while wales is due to set out its dementia action plan later this year .
a northern ireland dementia strategy is currently being developed and is expected to be released for consultation in coming months .
