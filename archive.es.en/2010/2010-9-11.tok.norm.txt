disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

japanese attacker shinji kagawa doubled the tally in the 65th minute , sliding the ball past keeper diego benaglio .
" the victory was more than deserved .
we were constantly a threat in the box but we needed the goal by sahin , " said dortmund trainer juergen klopp .
mcclaren said his players appeared not to have recovered from a 4-3 defeat to mainz in their previous game .
" the pressure is growing on us , we know that , " he said .

" banking industry sources told the dpa news agency the bank would now need an additional 20 billion euros for 2010 plus 20 billion euros to cope with short-term liquidity problems .
german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .
hre , which specializes in property lending , was the only german bank to fail a europe-wide stress test in july . liquidity squeeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre was nationalized in 2008 the bank used the state guarantees refinance its debt on the financial markets at affordable interest rates .

it is highly exposed to bonds issued by troubled eurozone countries like greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain . the munich-based bank said last month it had reduced its losses , but declined to say how much it expects to lose this year or to issue a forecast for 2011 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 11.09.2010 bitter debate over ' ground zero mosque ' marks 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build the mosque near ' ground zero ' touched a nerve a plan to build an islamic cultural center and prayer room in the shadow of " ground zero " has set off a virulent debate between advocates of religious freedom and those who decry the move as incendiary . the uproar centers around a project known as park51 , named for the address at 51 park place in manhattan where a moderate imam , faisal abdul rauf , plans to erect an islamic community center and mosque . the plan has been in discussion since 2009 , and muslims have already been using the space for prayer since the fall of that year .
but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .

it is highly exposed to bonds issued by troubled eurozone countries like greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain . the munich-based bank said last month it had reduced its losses , but declined to say how much it expects to lose this year or to issue a forecast for 2011 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

" banking industry sources told the dpa news agency the bank would now need an additional 20 billion euros for 2010 plus 20 billion euros to cope with short-term liquidity problems .
german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .

the suspect , who appeared in court saturday , denied the charges against him - including possession of a firearm - and said through a french interpreter that he can remember neither his name nor age .
the man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg , news agency ritzau reported .
media reports have suggested several different origins for the man , ranging from north africa to luxembourg .
police on heightened alert jakob scharf , head of the danish security and intelligence service -lrb- pet -rrb- , said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location .
" there are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack . "

police surrounded the suspect in nearby oersted park , where security personnel removed a bag wrapped around his waist with remote controlled cutting pliers .
police then shot at the bag .
a police spokesman said on friday the bag probably did not contain explosives as it did not explode .
pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .
the suspect , who remains in hospital care , appeared to be around 40 years old and spoke excellent english , aabye added .
the hotel where the blast occurred has been evacuated , and the park remained sealed off saturday as police continued searching for explosives and other evidence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .
" these are people who have gone out and found things that they 're thinking : maybe this will work .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .
" these are people who have gone out and found things that they 're thinking : maybe this will work .

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 11.09.2010 bitter debate over ' ground zero mosque ' marks 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build the mosque near ' ground zero ' touched a nerve a plan to build an islamic cultural center and prayer room in the shadow of " ground zero " has set off a virulent debate between advocates of religious freedom and those who decry the move as incendiary . the uproar centers around a project known as park51 , named for the address at 51 park place in manhattan where a moderate imam , faisal abdul rauf , plans to erect an islamic community center and mosque . the plan has been in discussion since 2009 , and muslims have already been using the space for prayer since the fall of that year .
but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .

this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .

" you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .

" you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

advocates say a psychological barrier to a more modern economy has been crossed , but critics say the new revenue is being used to delay reforms . in an attempt to fill budget gaps and offset a soaring public debt , poland 's treasury has announced a push to privatize major companies before the end of the year .
it hopes to gain some 6.5 billion euros by doing so . analysts , however , wonder how realistic this target is , and some potential strategic investors say that the prices set for some of the companies up for sale are too high . when the decision to sell a majority stake in two power companies , enea and energa , was announced by the polish treasury last year , both investment opportunities looked like winning propositions .
operating in a recently liberalized power market , they had gone through a restructuring process that had started generating good financial results .
poland itself looked like an ideal place to invest , as the only europe economy that actually grew last year .
but the expected scramble for shares did n't materialize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rwe pulled out of an investment deal into poland 's enea one potential strategic investor in enea , german energy giant rwe , pulled out of talks , claiming that the price was too high .
others expressed doubts about poland 's economic future after the country 's government revealed that public debt was soaring . enea 's president , maciej owczarek , is confident that his company can still attract a good bid , even if the price needs to be revised . " of course , the price of enea shares fell considerably on the news that rwe had given up its acquisition plans , " owczarek told deutsche welle .
" but the value of the company seems to have been appreciated by the market nevertheless .
a development program launched last year is being continued .
in the coming months , i expect the company 's market value to grow even further . " government says it 's being upfront when it comes to the overall shape of polish finances , finance minister jacek rostowski says the country 's troubles are nothing like those faced by greece , or the country 's closer neighbors hungary and latvia . " poland is indeed the only country which registered growth in 2009 when all our neighbors experienced recession , " he said .
" poland has pursued very prudent fiscal policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister rostowski says poland 's financial difficulties have been exaggerated the country 's deficit is about a third of the greek one , and fears its economy might spin out of control are grossly exaggerated , according to rostowski .
instead , the country is simply being upfront about its statistics . " we 've introduced very fundamental reforms , and of course we are determined to improve our fiscal performance , and reduce our deficit over the next couple of years in line with our obligations towards the european union , " he said .
" according to european union figures and projections , poland will have the third lowest growth in the ratio of debt to gdp during 2010 . ” psychological barrier broken some say the fast-paced privatization push has broken an important psychological barrier : for the first time , the polish government is ready to sell off industries it regards as strategic .
until recently , there was a marked reluctance to put chemical plants and fuel groups up for sale , for fear that they might be snapped up by russia . now , privatization is regarded much more pragmatically as a way of slashing the budget deficit .
in addition to the 6.5 billion euros hoped for this year , even more sales are planned for 2011 .
half of this year 's target has already been met , largely owing to two very successful initial public offerings involving the pzu insurance company and tauron energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish treasury minister aleksander grad says privatization will continue polish treasury minister aleksander grad is optimistic more companies will be privatized before the year 's end .
financial markets are now calmer than they were during 2009 , when not a single sale was made during the first half of the year . " we expect that the privatization target for 2010 can be met , " he said .
" an overall figure of 2 billion euros was scored by the end of -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , and this was nearly doubled in the first eight months of this year .
if we consistently carry on the privatization plan , we are confident we can succeed . " critics call privatization a budget patch yet , some critics have described poland 's privatization program as a chaotic attempt to patch up the budget and delay crucial actions like reforming the health care system .
there are those who say that ahead of next year 's parliamentary elections , the government of prime minister donald tusk may avoid upsetting voters by not pushing controversial schemes like the privatization of publicly funded hospitals . however agata urbanska , an analyst with ing bank , believes the polish government still has a few options left , even if its privatization plans do n't fully work out .
for instance , poland could still issue more bonds if asset sales disappoint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish energy company energa is also slated to be privatized " there are good and bad things about this budget deficit , " she said .
" what the government did was present the worst possible picture , so going forward there might be positive surprises .
the budget for 2010 is based on fairly conservative assumptions about growth and inflation , but the other side , financing , was more optimistic , with assumed privatization revenues quite substantial . " poland continues to promote itself as the only european economy spared by the crisis .
slawomir majman , the president of the polish information and foreign investment agency , is convinced that poland 's privatization program has a lot going for it . " poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply and this product is economic stability , " majman said .

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privatization -pipe- 11.09.2010 poland privatizes companies to plug deficit hole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's effort to privatize two energy companies has made bumpy progress poland is privatizing its major companies to generate much needed revenue .
advocates say a psychological barrier to a more modern economy has been crossed , but critics say the new revenue is being used to delay reforms . in an attempt to fill budget gaps and offset a soaring public debt , poland 's treasury has announced a push to privatize major companies before the end of the year .
it hopes to gain some 6.5 billion euros by doing so . analysts , however , wonder how realistic this target is , and some potential strategic investors say that the prices set for some of the companies up for sale are too high . when the decision to sell a majority stake in two power companies , enea and energa , was announced by the polish treasury last year , both investment opportunities looked like winning propositions .
operating in a recently liberalized power market , they had gone through a restructuring process that had started generating good financial results .
poland itself looked like an ideal place to invest , as the only europe economy that actually grew last year .
but the expected scramble for shares did n't materialize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rwe pulled out of an investment deal into poland 's enea one potential strategic investor in enea , german energy giant rwe , pulled out of talks , claiming that the price was too high .
others expressed doubts about poland 's economic future after the country 's government revealed that public debt was soaring . enea 's president , maciej owczarek , is confident that his company can still attract a good bid , even if the price needs to be revised . " of course , the price of enea shares fell considerably on the news that rwe had given up its acquisition plans , " owczarek told deutsche welle .
" but the value of the company seems to have been appreciated by the market nevertheless .
a development program launched last year is being continued .
in the coming months , i expect the company 's market value to grow even further . " government says it 's being upfront when it comes to the overall shape of polish finances , finance minister jacek rostowski says the country 's troubles are nothing like those faced by greece , or the country 's closer neighbors hungary and latvia . " poland is indeed the only country which registered growth in 2009 when all our neighbors experienced recession , " he said .
" poland has pursued very prudent fiscal policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister rostowski says poland 's financial difficulties have been exaggerated the country 's deficit is about a third of the greek one , and fears its economy might spin out of control are grossly exaggerated , according to rostowski .
instead , the country is simply being upfront about its statistics . " we 've introduced very fundamental reforms , and of course we are determined to improve our fiscal performance , and reduce our deficit over the next couple of years in line with our obligations towards the european union , " he said .
" according to european union figures and projections , poland will have the third lowest growth in the ratio of debt to gdp during 2010 . ” psychological barrier broken some say the fast-paced privatization push has broken an important psychological barrier : for the first time , the polish government is ready to sell off industries it regards as strategic .
until recently , there was a marked reluctance to put chemical plants and fuel groups up for sale , for fear that they might be snapped up by russia . now , privatization is regarded much more pragmatically as a way of slashing the budget deficit .
in addition to the 6.5 billion euros hoped for this year , even more sales are planned for 2011 .
half of this year 's target has already been met , largely owing to two very successful initial public offerings involving the pzu insurance company and tauron energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish treasury minister aleksander grad says privatization will continue polish treasury minister aleksander grad is optimistic more companies will be privatized before the year 's end .
financial markets are now calmer than they were during 2009 , when not a single sale was made during the first half of the year . " we expect that the privatization target for 2010 can be met , " he said .
" an overall figure of 2 billion euros was scored by the end of -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , and this was nearly doubled in the first eight months of this year .
if we consistently carry on the privatization plan , we are confident we can succeed . " critics call privatization a budget patch yet , some critics have described poland 's privatization program as a chaotic attempt to patch up the budget and delay crucial actions like reforming the health care system .
there are those who say that ahead of next year 's parliamentary elections , the government of prime minister donald tusk may avoid upsetting voters by not pushing controversial schemes like the privatization of publicly funded hospitals . however agata urbanska , an analyst with ing bank , believes the polish government still has a few options left , even if its privatization plans do n't fully work out .
for instance , poland could still issue more bonds if asset sales disappoint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish energy company energa is also slated to be privatized " there are good and bad things about this budget deficit , " she said .
" what the government did was present the worst possible picture , so going forward there might be positive surprises .
the budget for 2010 is based on fairly conservative assumptions about growth and inflation , but the other side , financing , was more optimistic , with assumed privatization revenues quite substantial . " poland continues to promote itself as the only european economy spared by the crisis .
slawomir majman , the president of the polish information and foreign investment agency , is convinced that poland 's privatization program has a lot going for it . " poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply and this product is economic stability , " majman said .
" that 's why a number of foreign corporations from western europe – and not just from western europe – are now paying much more attention to poland than ever before .
poland is the ripe and safe harbor for investments in 2010 . ” still , others say that even if poland does succeed in attracting enough strategic investors , in the long term it will need to do more than sell off its crown jewels to ensure a balanced budget . author : rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- gps -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privatization -pipe- 11.09.2010 poland privatizes companies to plug deficit hole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's effort to privatize two energy companies has made bumpy progress poland is privatizing its major companies to generate much needed revenue .
advocates say a psychological barrier to a more modern economy has been crossed , but critics say the new revenue is being used to delay reforms . in an attempt to fill budget gaps and offset a soaring public debt , poland 's treasury has announced a push to privatize major companies before the end of the year .
it hopes to gain some 6.5 billion euros by doing so . analysts , however , wonder how realistic this target is , and some potential strategic investors say that the prices set for some of the companies up for sale are too high . when the decision to sell a majority stake in two power companies , enea and energa , was announced by the polish treasury last year , both investment opportunities looked like winning propositions .
operating in a recently liberalized power market , they had gone through a restructuring process that had started generating good financial results .
poland itself looked like an ideal place to invest , as the only europe economy that actually grew last year .
but the expected scramble for shares did n't materialize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rwe pulled out of an investment deal into poland 's enea one potential strategic investor in enea , german energy giant rwe , pulled out of talks , claiming that the price was too high .
others expressed doubts about poland 's economic future after the country 's government revealed that public debt was soaring . enea 's president , maciej owczarek , is confident that his company can still attract a good bid , even if the price needs to be revised . " of course , the price of enea shares fell considerably on the news that rwe had given up its acquisition plans , " owczarek told deutsche welle .
" but the value of the company seems to have been appreciated by the market nevertheless .
a development program launched last year is being continued .
in the coming months , i expect the company 's market value to grow even further . " government says it 's being upfront when it comes to the overall shape of polish finances , finance minister jacek rostowski says the country 's troubles are nothing like those faced by greece , or the country 's closer neighbors hungary and latvia . " poland is indeed the only country which registered growth in 2009 when all our neighbors experienced recession , " he said .
" poland has pursued very prudent fiscal policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister rostowski says poland 's financial difficulties have been exaggerated the country 's deficit is about a third of the greek one , and fears its economy might spin out of control are grossly exaggerated , according to rostowski .
instead , the country is simply being upfront about its statistics . " we 've introduced very fundamental reforms , and of course we are determined to improve our fiscal performance , and reduce our deficit over the next couple of years in line with our obligations towards the european union , " he said .
" according to european union figures and projections , poland will have the third lowest growth in the ratio of debt to gdp during 2010 . ” psychological barrier broken some say the fast-paced privatization push has broken an important psychological barrier : for the first time , the polish government is ready to sell off industries it regards as strategic .
until recently , there was a marked reluctance to put chemical plants and fuel groups up for sale , for fear that they might be snapped up by russia . now , privatization is regarded much more pragmatically as a way of slashing the budget deficit .
in addition to the 6.5 billion euros hoped for this year , even more sales are planned for 2011 .
half of this year 's target has already been met , largely owing to two very successful initial public offerings involving the pzu insurance company and tauron energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish treasury minister aleksander grad says privatization will continue polish treasury minister aleksander grad is optimistic more companies will be privatized before the year 's end .
financial markets are now calmer than they were during 2009 , when not a single sale was made during the first half of the year . " we expect that the privatization target for 2010 can be met , " he said .
" an overall figure of 2 billion euros was scored by the end of -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , and this was nearly doubled in the first eight months of this year .
if we consistently carry on the privatization plan , we are confident we can succeed . " critics call privatization a budget patch yet , some critics have described poland 's privatization program as a chaotic attempt to patch up the budget and delay crucial actions like reforming the health care system .
there are those who say that ahead of next year 's parliamentary elections , the government of prime minister donald tusk may avoid upsetting voters by not pushing controversial schemes like the privatization of publicly funded hospitals . however agata urbanska , an analyst with ing bank , believes the polish government still has a few options left , even if its privatization plans do n't fully work out .
for instance , poland could still issue more bonds if asset sales disappoint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish energy company energa is also slated to be privatized " there are good and bad things about this budget deficit , " she said .
" what the government did was present the worst possible picture , so going forward there might be positive surprises .
the budget for 2010 is based on fairly conservative assumptions about growth and inflation , but the other side , financing , was more optimistic , with assumed privatization revenues quite substantial . " poland continues to promote itself as the only european economy spared by the crisis .
slawomir majman , the president of the polish information and foreign investment agency , is convinced that poland 's privatization program has a lot going for it . " poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply and this product is economic stability , " majman said .
" that 's why a number of foreign corporations from western europe – and not just from western europe – are now paying much more attention to poland than ever before .
poland is the ripe and safe harbor for investments in 2010 . ” still , others say that even if poland does succeed in attracting enough strategic investors , in the long term it will need to do more than sell off its crown jewels to ensure a balanced budget . author : rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- gps -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" banking industry sources told the dpa news agency the bank would now need an additional 20 billion euros for 2010 plus 20 billion euros to cope with short-term liquidity problems .
german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .

it is highly exposed to bonds issued by troubled eurozone countries like greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain . the munich-based bank said last month it had reduced its losses , but declined to say how much it expects to lose this year or to issue a forecast for 2011 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "

" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .

" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

" banking industry sources told the dpa news agency the bank would now need an additional 20 billion euros for 2010 plus 20 billion euros to cope with short-term liquidity problems .
german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

the man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg , news agency ritzau reported .
media reports have suggested several different origins for the man , ranging from north africa to luxembourg .
police on heightened alert jakob scharf , head of the danish security and intelligence service -lrb- pet -rrb- , said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location .
" there are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack . "

"
suspect seen running from site of the blast police arrested the man friday after he was seen running from the site of the blast , joergensen hotel in central copenhagen .
police surrounded the suspect in nearby oersted park , where security personnel removed a bag wrapped around his waist with remote controlled cutting pliers .
police then shot at the bag .
a police spokesman said on friday the bag probably did not contain explosives as it did not explode .
pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .
the suspect , who remains in hospital care , appeared to be around 40 years old and spoke excellent english , aabye added .
the hotel where the blast occurred has been evacuated , and the park remained sealed off saturday as police continued searching for explosives and other evidence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .
" these are people who have gone out and found things that they 're thinking : maybe this will work .
it 's a gamble , not an investment . " author : stephen beard , david levitz editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg , news agency ritzau reported .
media reports have suggested several different origins for the man , ranging from north africa to luxembourg .
police on heightened alert jakob scharf , head of the danish security and intelligence service -lrb- pet -rrb- , said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location .
" there are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack . "

police surrounded the suspect in nearby oersted park , where security personnel removed a bag wrapped around his waist with remote controlled cutting pliers .
police then shot at the bag .
a police spokesman said on friday the bag probably did not contain explosives as it did not explode .
pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .
the suspect , who remains in hospital care , appeared to be around 40 years old and spoke excellent english , aabye added .

the man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg , news agency ritzau reported .
media reports have suggested several different origins for the man , ranging from north africa to luxembourg .
police on heightened alert jakob scharf , head of the danish security and intelligence service -lrb- pet -rrb- , said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location .
" there are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack . "

police surrounded the suspect in nearby oersted park , where security personnel removed a bag wrapped around his waist with remote controlled cutting pliers .
police then shot at the bag .
a police spokesman said on friday the bag probably did not contain explosives as it did not explode .
pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 11.09.2010 east germany 's doping program casts long shadow over victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many gdr athletes were given performance-enhancing drugs the sports doping program carried out by the former east germany may be decades in the past , but many one-time athletes still carry the scars - physical and mental - from that time . berlin resident birgit boese can get to work and back home every day , but that 's about all she can manage .
the 48-year-old former athlete depends on crutches to get around , and she and her husband have to forego visits together to the theater , movies or local swimming pool .
" because of the pain , we ca n't really take part in public life , " she said .
once groomed to compete in the shot put and compete against the world 's top athletes , today she says she suffers from an irregular heartbeat , high-blood pressure , diabetes , nerve damage , kidney problems , and a list of other ailments that have made her all but an invalid .
she says she knows what is to blame for her poor health - little blue pills she was given by her coaches at a special sports school in the german democratic republic starting at age 11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boese wants the government to make it easier for doping victims to get state aid she was told they were vitamins ; now she knows they were anabolic steroids , meant to increase her muscle mass , strengthen her endurance and put her on in the center of the winners ' podium at the olympics , gold around her neck .
she and 183 other former athletes who were victims of communist east germany 's notorious doping program , many of whom still suffer from the long-term effects of the drugs , were awarded compensation in 2006 from the german olympic sports organization -lrb- dosb -rrb- and the drug company jenapharm .
each received 9,250 euros -lrb- $ 12,200 -rrb- from the pharmaceutical company in an out-of-court settlement and 170 of the plaintiffs were paid another 9,250 euros from the dosb .
" it helped , sure , " she said .
" but for those with chronic illnesses and who have to pay out of pocket for medications , the money did n't go that far . "
massive scale it is estimated that some 9,000 former athletes , perhaps more , were doped in a program that ran for decades up until 1989 with approval from the highest levels of the east german government .
many , like boese , were given the pills as minors .
estimates are that two million tablets of performance enhancing drugs , mostly anabolic steroids , were given out each year to athletes .
many later developed cancer , ovarian cysts , liver damage , heart disease , infertility and other ailments .
some had children with health problems , such as blindness or club feet .
" certainly people were not aware of the long-term effects of the drug use and , in my opinion , dramatically underestimated them , " wilhelm schaenzer , head of the institute for biochemistry at the german sports university in cologne , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi krieger at the european championships in 1986 what was not underestimated was the zeal in which the communist east german government pursued its goal of winning gold medals at the olympics and other sporting events .
it was seen as a way to show that its ideological system was superior , not only politically , but in the sporting arena as well .
" there was always a rationale behind the madness , " steven ungerleider , a sports psychologist and author of a book on east germany 's doping program called " faust 's gold , " said .
coaches , trainers and parents would watch as their young daughters suddenly exhibited unusual amounts of body hair , bulked up rapidly , and developed deep voices .
" there was a sick joke running around that when women olympic swimmers would go into the changing room and see east german girls there , they 'd say , ' oh my god , we must be in the men 's locker room . " '
medal factory despite the near cartoonish appearance of some of their athletes , the doping program delivered results .
from 1972 to 1988 , the country of 17 million won 384 olympic medals , not including the 1984 los angeles games , which they boycotted .
they always placed well ahead of the much larger west germany .
the human cost of those victories is still being felt today .
probably the best-known case is that of andreas krieger , who competed as heidi krieger for east germany and was european shot put champion in 1986 .
krieger was systematically doped and her body underwent dramatic changes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi , on his way to testify at a 2000 doping trial in 1997 , heidi underwent a sex change and now lives as a man .
he is still struggling with the aftereffects - both physical and mental - of the doping , which was done without her knowledge .
barbara boese says over the years she has had contact with some 600 former athletes ; she used to run a counseling drop-in center for them .
for many of them , she says , their health has gotten worse over the years .
justice served ?
manfred hoeppner , the gdr 's top sports doctor , and manfred ewald , a former east german sports minister , are considered the primary architects of the country 's doping program .
they were convicted in court on charges of being accessories to intentional bodily harm of athletes , including minors .
both received probation .
also in 2000 , lothar kipke , a former senior consultant to the east german swimming association , was fined several thousand euros and given a 15-month suspended jail sentence .
and last year , five former gdr coaches , all of whom currently coach germany 's top track-and-field stars , confessed to having participating in the doping program to enhance athletes ' performances .
all members of the group , including long-jump coach rainer pottel , discus coach gerhard boettcher , javelin coach maria ritschel , shot-put coach klaus schneider and heptathlon coach klaus baarck , have been told they can keep their jobs .
" some former athletes have come to peace with what happened , " boese said .
" but when they see their former coaches at sporting events sitting there , then many of them become very bitter , even furious . "
lesson learned ?
doping is still a problem in many sports today , although observers say it is unlikely it is practiced on such a scale as in the former east germany .
testing procedures have become much more rigorous over the past 20 years and sanctions for those caught cheating have become more severe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing controls have gotten more rigorous and have had a deterrent effect " today we know that the use of such substances by athletes or even recreational athletes has very serious consequences , " said schaenzer .
" even though , of course , abuse continues . "
that is something that birgit boese has a hard time understanding , since she lives every day with the effects of doping .
when she sees a news report about another athlete caught using performance-enhancing drugs , she usually just shakes her head .
" i think , the poor fool , " she said .
" today athletes can decide to keep away from the drugs before they ruin their health .
but maybe the lure of becoming rich and famous is so great that all reason just flies out the window . "

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .
the suspect , who remains in hospital care , appeared to be around 40 years old and spoke excellent english , aabye added .
the hotel where the blast occurred has been evacuated , and the park remained sealed off saturday as police continued searching for explosives and other evidence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds .

" banking industry sources told the dpa news agency the bank would now need an additional 20 billion euros for 2010 plus 20 billion euros to cope with short-term liquidity problems .
german media quoted other sources as saying that the new state guarantees were a " precautionary measure . " the property lender has already received nearly 8 billion euros in cash injections from soffin along with 103.5 billion euros in loan guarantees .
hre , which specializes in property lending , was the only german bank to fail a europe-wide stress test in july . liquidity squeeze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre was nationalized in 2008 the bank used the state guarantees refinance its debt on the financial markets at affordable interest rates .
in july it created a " bad bank " to which it plans to transfer 210 billion euros in risk positions and non-strategic assets . it is an " extremely complex process and certainly exceptional , given the volume " of assets to be transferred , but its success would mark " a decisive turning point in the restructuring of hypo real eastate , " soffin spokesman hannes rehm said in a statement . the bank was nationalized last year after narrowly avoiding bankruptcy in late 2008 .
it is highly exposed to bonds issued by troubled eurozone countries like greece , ireland , italy , portugal and spain . the munich-based bank said last month it had reduced its losses , but declined to say how much it expects to lose this year or to issue a forecast for 2011 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man appeared on cruches with injuries to his face and was missing the lower part of one leg , news agency ritzau reported .
media reports have suggested several different origins for the man , ranging from north africa to luxembourg .
police on heightened alert jakob scharf , head of the danish security and intelligence service -lrb- pet -rrb- , said in a statement that police believed the explosive detonated was intended for a different location .
" there are circumstances that point towards an unsuccessful terror attack . "

"
suspect seen running from site of the blast police arrested the man friday after he was seen running from the site of the blast , joergensen hotel in central copenhagen .
police surrounded the suspect in nearby oersted park , where security personnel removed a bag wrapped around his waist with remote controlled cutting pliers .
police then shot at the bag .
a police spokesman said on friday the bag probably did not contain explosives as it did not explode .
pet said it was too early to say if it was a case of terrorism , adding that it could also not be ruled out if the perpetrator had accomplices .
" due to this , we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police 's attention regarding suspect situations , " aabye said .
the suspect , who remains in hospital care , appeared to be around 40 years old and spoke excellent english , aabye added .
the hotel where the blast occurred has been evacuated , and the park remained sealed off saturday as police continued searching for explosives and other evidence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "

" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether . " sometimes people have to accept that the past has happened … and it 's best just to leave it alone , " said economic historian tim leunig of the london school of economics .
" certainly when it 's some really dramatic event like ...
hitler , the second world war and the post-war german settlement , that 's enough history to accept that .
the past is the past . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany claims the bonds could have been stolen by russian soldiers leunig said the american litigants are just out for a quick buck and have no moral claim against today 's government in berlin . " these are not people who paid a dollar and are now looking for a dollar back , " he said .

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together .

" arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu foreign ministers met to debate the future of turkey 's relationship with the bloc . the european union is split on the issue of turkey joining the eu and little progress has been made on membership the negotiations which began in 2005 .
but turkey 's clout on the international stage has been growing and , according to eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton , the country is an ally to the eu on several key issues . ashton , along with foreign ministers from the eu member countries and turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu met in brussels on saturday to discuss the future of the relationship between the 27-member bloc and turkey . " the purpose of today 's debate is … to recognize that as well as a candidate country , turkey is a partner with us in lots of issues across the world , " ashton said as she arrived for the informal meeting . turkey has , for example , taken a leading role in discussions with iran over its disputed nuclear program and the middle east peace process , added belgian foreign minister steven vanackere . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy have both rejected the idea of turkey 's membership , suggesting instead a " privileged partnership . " while officially turkey remains a candidate for eu membership and talks are ongoing , little progress has been made public .
of the 35 chapters that make up the eu 's screening process for new members , officials have provisionally closed talks on just one section with negotiations continuing in only eight more . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said it 's important , however , that turkey see that the europe is serious about working together . " as europeans , we have great interest in making sure that turkey remains oriented towards the west and does not reorient itself , " he said . bildunterschrift : westerwelle wants turkey to look to the west but wo n't offer full eu membership gaining influence britain , italy and finland have pushed for accession talks to move forward . " arguably , turkey today is more influential in the world than any of our member states , together or separately , " said finnish foreign minister alexander stubb .
" we 're not talking about some kind of privileged partnership ; we 're talking about deep integration and cooperation . " one part of the accession process is that turkey must bring its laws in line with those of the eu .
on sunday , turkish voters are set to weigh in on a package of constitutional reforms that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said would bring turkey more in line with eu norms . critics have , however , charged that the changes would remove critical checks on the ruling party 's power and undermine turkey 's secular state . author : holly fox -lrb- ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 11.09.2010 bitter debate over ' ground zero mosque ' marks 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build the mosque near ' ground zero ' touched a nerve a plan to build an islamic cultural center and prayer room in the shadow of " ground zero " has set off a virulent debate between advocates of religious freedom and those who decry the move as incendiary . the uproar centers around a project known as park51 , named for the address at 51 park place in manhattan where a moderate imam , faisal abdul rauf , plans to erect an islamic community center and mosque . the plan has been in discussion since 2009 , and muslims have already been using the space for prayer since the fall of that year .
but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

disgruntled with her party , she has threatened to resign and called for an ultra-conservative protest party . a prominent member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , who stands accused of revising world war ii history , said saturday that the german electorate would welcome a new political party right of the cdu .
" if someone with charisma set out to found a new , really conservative party , he would easily overcome the 5 percent hurdle , " erika steinbach told the welt am sonntag newspaper , referring to the percentage of votes needed for a party to enter parliament .
steinbach announced friday that she intended to step down in november , after a decade on the national executive of the cdu , saying she no longer felt at home in the party .
on saturday , steinbach took a softer line , saying she wanted to make it work in the cdu but maintaining that she could leave at any time .
she said germany 's neighbors hosted right-wing protest parties and that such parties could be founded in germany too .
bavarian state premier horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's sister party the christian social union , reacted against steinbach 's warnings .
to avoid the founding of such a protest party , he said , germany 's conservatives needed to address people 's fears concerning the integration of immigrants and take concrete action in the matter .
" there will not be any party -lsb- right of ours -rsb- , " he said .
" we blocked them after the war and will continue to block them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer says any right-wing protest party will be blocked accused of revisionism steinbach , who , as head of the federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , represents 12.5 million germans expelled from eastern europe after world war ii , came under fire this week for defending two members of her league whose statements implied that poland was the blame for world war ii .
" i can not change the fact that poland mobilized -lsb- its troops -rsb- as early as march 1939 , " steinbach said at a cdu party meeting , repeating the pretext the nazis used to invade their eastern neighbor later that year .
steinbach further defended herself saturday in her speech at the bdv 's annual " day of the homeland , " saying that accusations that she and the bdv were historical revisionists were part of a " concerted campaign " against her .
" everyone knows who began the second world war , " she said , adding , " everyone knows the atrocities of nazi germany , and the boundless suffering that thereby came to europe . "
defending sarrazin steinbach , an ethnic german born in present-day poland in 1943 , renewed her call for berlin to turn august 5 into a day of national remembrance for german expellees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach wants greater recognition for ethnic-german expellees refugees from africa and other continents , she said , were dignified by tears of sympathy .
" but when it comes to german expellees , they do n't even need a paper tissue . "
steinbach had already been steeped in controversy over recent months due to her involvement in discussions to open an exhibition and archive about post-world war ii expellees in berlin , which critics say could portray germany as a victim of the war .
steinbach stirred further controversy this week by defended contentious german central bank board member , thilo sarrazin , who resigned thursday amid nationwide controversy sparked by his statements that muslim immigrants were sponging off the german state and lowering the national intelligence .

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .

" you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .

" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement .

ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community .

" the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds .

now a group of us investors wants germany to pay out to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on the weimar republic era bonds . a us court of appeals in miami has ruled that the german government may be sued by american investors in an american court for failing to pay out on pre-nazi era bonds . " the court decided that the complaint filed against germany can proceed to discovery and that the case should not be dismissed because germany is a ' foreign sovereign , " ' said michael elsner , who represents tampa-based world holdings investment group , one of a handful of plaintiffs suing the german government . " we requested damages in the hundred of millions of dollars range .
it 's a number over $ 450 million -lrb- 354 million euros -rrb- , " elsner told news agency afp . the bonds were issued in the 1920s and early 1930s by the weimar republic , germany 's government from 1919 until adolf hitler 's rise to power in 1933 .
during that time , the government printed an enormous number of bonds to cover rebuilding costs in the aftermath of world war i. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler defaulted on the bonds when he came to power many of these bonds were purchased by american investors - with the encouragement of then us president calvin coolidge . although hitler defaulted on the bonds as germany 's new chancellor in 1933 , they continued to be traded by investors around the world , who hoped to someday turn them into cash . reviving dead bonds the plaintiffs in this case , contemporary investors who stockpiled the old bonds in order to bring suit against the germany , have argued that , should today 's federal republic of germany default on the weimar republic 's bonds , global trust in government bonds would collapse . " any government - german or any other government - needs to understand that if it 's going to borrow from people who put up money in good faith , the government will be held responsible for what it promised to do , " said sam dubbin , a miami lawyer involved in the case . " people who invest in government bonds deserve to be paid back and that 's what this litigation is intending to vindicate : that basic right , " said dubbin , who is best known for representing holocaust survivors seeking to reclaim stolen fortunes . germany contends bonds were paid - and ' maybe stolen ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suit could cost germany 's finance ministry billions germany , meanwhile , has opened a store of arguments to dispute it is defaulting at all . " they were paid already , " said ingrid jaeger of the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues in berlin .
" the bonds have no value anymore . " jaeger claims that under an international agreement in the 1950s , germany repaid most of its outstanding bonds , including all of those now held by american litigants : " there was a deadline -lsb- for claims -rsb- in 1958 , " jaeger added . the german government has also alluded to a number of weimar republic bonds stolen by soviet soldiers from nazi coffers at the end of world war ii , long after the government had bought them back . dubbin said his clients ' bonds could n't have been those stolen by soviet soldiers , adding that russia returned most of the stolen bonds and alleges that claim is supported by german documents . letting dead dogs lie with hundreds of millions - and potentially billions - of dollars at stake , others have dismissed the dispute altogether .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 11.09.2010 bitter debate over ' ground zero mosque ' marks 9/11 anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to build the mosque near ' ground zero ' touched a nerve a plan to build an islamic cultural center and prayer room in the shadow of " ground zero " has set off a virulent debate between advocates of religious freedom and those who decry the move as incendiary . the uproar centers around a project known as park51 , named for the address at 51 park place in manhattan where a moderate imam , faisal abdul rauf , plans to erect an islamic community center and mosque . the plan has been in discussion since 2009 , and muslims have already been using the space for prayer since the fall of that year .
but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .
" if you are a warrior , you do . " anti-islam activists in europe - where public debates over the building of mosques and minarets are commonplace - echoed that statement . " we think it is a calculated provocation , " said anders gravers , a spokesman for the group stop the islamization of europe .
" often when -lrb- muslims -rrb- have conquered something , they put a mosque on that place .
this happened in jerusalem , it happened in cordoba -lrb- spain -rrb- , and now it is happening in manhattan . " accusations of " muslim-bashing " " maybe they should show some respect for the families of the victims -lrb- of 9/11 -rrb- … if they want mutual understanding , they should find another place to build it , " gravers told deutsche welle . pamela geller of the group stop the islamization of america , was one of the first to mobilize opposition to park51 by bringing the topic to the attention of the mainstream us media . according to some muslim activists in the united states , the involvement of groups like the ones geller and gravers represent shows that the debate is really more about " muslim-bashing " than about the placement of the park51 mosque .
ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing inherently controversial about having an islamic community center in lower manhattan where you ca n't even see ground zero from the site . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .

but what was originally a local manhattan zoning question quickly flared into a national controversy after conservative bloggers zeroed in on the cause earlier this year and brought it to the mainstream media 's attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feisal abdul rauf -lrb- center -rrb- is behind the controversial project and the rhetoric has only gotten stronger as the ninth anniversary of the al qaeda attacks on the world trade center approached . rauf has repeatedly billed the center - which would replace one of one of the buildings that was damaged in the september 11 , 2001 suicide attacks - as a multi-faith initiative " intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures . " religious freedom meets cultural sensitivity but opponents have said that the choice of a site so close to " ground zero " is insensitive , at best - and that at worst it is a ploy by muslims to exploit us first amendment freedoms to further their own agenda . ex-new york mayor rudy giuliani spoke for many of those who oppose the cultural center when he said that , while the builders should be allowed to erect a mosque wherever they like , the plan was more likely to " create anger and hatred " than mutual understanding . " the reality is that right now , if you are a healer , you do not go forward with this project , " giuliani told us morning news program " today " in mid-august .

ibrahim hooper , the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations -lrb- cair -rrb- , characterized the controversy as being " manufactured by a small and vocal group of muslim-bashers " who pander to peoples ' basest fears . " you either have rights , or you do n't " " there has been a mosque in the neighborhood of the world trade center for 30 years and it has never been an issue before , " hooper told deutsche welle .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york mayor bloomberg has defended the mosque be that as it may , recent polls show between 50 percent and 70 percent of the population oppose building the mosque , for the same reason cited by former mayor giuliani : it shows a lack of respect for the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
at the same time , more than 60 percent agreed that rauf has the right to build the mosque wherever he wants . " i do n't think constitutional rights should be subjected to mob rule .
or even majority vote .
rights are rights , and you either have them , or you do n't , " said cair 's hooper , in reply to those statistics .
then he added : " and you know , i wonder which right former mayor giuliani would agree to give up due to the sensitivities of other people . " public opinion is being distorted by rhetoric spread by the far right in the us , which has co-opted the controversy in order to " exploit the legitimate emotions generated by the 9/11 terror attacks to promote their agenda of hate and intolerance , " according to hooper . ' kulturkampf ' as election strategy ? as us midterm elections approach on november 2 , even some conservative commentators have said it appears that the " ground zero mosque " - where the disgruntled-populist tea party movement is staging a rally on the anniversary of 9/11 - is being used as an emotional vote-getting gambit by conservatives . " the park51 controversy is a red herring , " wrote gene healy , a vice president of the conservative cato institute , in the dc examiner .
" faced with difficult choices , the alleged party of small government always retreats to the lazy politics of kulturkampf . " defenders of the park51 project include us president barack obama and - more vocally - current new york mayor michael bloomberg , who also said he believes the controversy will die down as soon as the election is over .
both politicians said they believe the planners ' first amendment rights trump any questions over the appropriateness of the mosque 's location . " if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the world trade center site , we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom , " bloomberg said last month in a speech . comparisons with pre-war germany cair 's hooper said he believes the islamophobic hate speech being used against muslims - who make up 0.8 percent of the us population - is reminiscent of the kind of rhetoric used against the relatively tiny jewish community in pre-world war ii germany . " it 's the same rhetoric of people taking over , of undue influence , " he said .
" it was wrong when it was used to target the jewish community , and it is wrong when it is used to target the muslim community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those involved debate the site 's ' sacred ' status but gravers , of stop the islamization of europe , disagreed : " you can not compare muslims with the jews in berlin , because they are absolutely not victims .
the jewish population never made any terror attacks at all .
this debate is about understanding peoples ' feelings , not about persecution . " coping with the radicals imam rauf , who is reported to have dedicated his pulpit to moderate intercultural discourse , was abroad on a us state department-sponsored speaking tour for much of the controversy .
but he finally spoke out in an interview late wednesday with cnn , saying that if he had known how much pain the decision would cause , he would have chosen another site . while he acknowledged that " nothing is off the table " when it comes to the project , he did say that at this point , there was no choice but to stick to the plan . " you can not heal a trauma by walking away from it , " he said .
" if we move from that location , the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse .
the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack . " now , he plans to continue with the project , and try to " advance a discourse on peace .
