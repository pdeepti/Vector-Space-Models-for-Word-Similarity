program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 stealthy leverkusen reaps the rewards of hiding in plain sight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are making a low-key assault on the summit there have been so many surprises so far this season that the bundesliga is in no short supply of media darlings .
bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .
in 2002 , pool re removed exclusion clauses for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks .
the need for terrorism insurance has become more apparent since the sept .

deutsche bank later found itself in a legal dispute with the allianz and axa insurance companies , which disputed the status of the building as a total loss .
some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

new delhi accused islamabad of failing in its promise to punish the alleged masterminds . when gunmen targeted india 's financial hub and symbol of the country ’ s economic rise on november 26 2008 , the media were quick to describe the carefully-orchestrated attacks as india ’ s " 9/11 . "
they soon became known as india ’ s " 26/11 . "
two years later , the wounds have not healed , says security expert afsar karim in new delhi : " this is because those behind the attacks have not yet been brought to justice .
the threat , which emanates from pakistan , has not lessened because pakistan has not acted against the terror groups which operated from its territory .
a wound can only heal if there is no danger that something like this will be repeated . " bildunterschrift : gunmen assailed mumbai 's victoria central station and several other buildings on " 26/11 " the attacks did little to improve the already tense relations between india and pakistan .
the only surviving gunman ajmal amir kasab , who is pakistani , has said that the officially banned pakistan-based terror group , lashkar-e-taiba , was behind the bloodbath . new delhi has accused islamabad of being slow to look into the cause of the attacks and of conducting its investigation half-heartedly .
lashkar-e-taiba and its head hafiz saeed are thought to have close connections to pakistan 's secret services . delhi claims the highest circles in pakistan must have been aware of the plans to attack mumbai . better relations needed between india and pakistan " i am one of those who think it is important for the whole region that india and pakistan have good relations , " says amitabh mattoo , a political expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university . " for india as an aspiring nation it is very important to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors .
four years ago , there were some good talks with pakistan under former president musharraf and many thought this might lead to a breakthrough . " but after the mumbai attacks , india wanted pakistan to act against lashkar-e-taiba and yet the founders are still running free , holding speeches all over the country .
if the pakistani government doesn ’ t change its attitude , the instability will go on . " slow implementation of reforms after the attacks , the indian government announced it would invest more in security and prevention .
police reforms were introduced and the media , which were accused of playing into the hands of the terrorists with their reporting , agreed to act according to a code of honor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian home minister p. chidambaram paid tribute to the victims on the second anniversary they said that they would censor themselves at times of crisis and not talk about security plans for instance . " there have been reforms but these have perhaps not been implemented as fast as we would have liked , " explained afsar karim . " the reforms could help to gather more information about terrorist activities inside india .
but activities outside of india can not be prevented .
if the problem of terrorism is not tackled at its root there could be hundreds of new targets and we wo n't be able to do anything against the threat . " in response to india 's repeated criticism , pakistan 's foreign minister said on friday that it was the government 's " desire to punish those involved " in the mumbai attacks . author : priya esselborn editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro what role do you think germany should play in stabilizing the eurozone ?
none !
dismantle the eu and the euro as quickly as possible before the entire eu ends up in one big , deep hole out of which there is no escape .
the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .
due to the expansion of the eu in jurisdiction and its administrative power , this has seemed to be sped through very quickly without much critical thinking to the point where it has may have overextended the whole project in its scope from what is practical . - philip , canada your article quoted herr heinemann , of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany , as saying , " does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ? "
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .
to employ an american idiom , europe is whistling past the graveyard on this issue . - michael , us ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections ireland is another country that proves that the euro can not succeed in practice . - davor , serbia cowen puts the burden on the back of families , students , workers , unemployed , health service , police and firefighters .
i wish there was an election to tell the politicians via bad language that they are traitors and gangsters to this country ...
the politicians are out of touch - they are living on the backs of the people . - michael , ireland germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax the irish republic must alter its budget so that all sectors contribute fairly .
it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .
many are little more than fly-by-nighters , who will simply move on when it looks like their activities will be put under the spotlight and seen as little more than shell companies who have contributed nothing to the nation . - roland , new zealand specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland is property in some european countries simply overvalued ?
this is mostly a result of easily attainable credit in the boom times .
another small country , iceland , also had credit access in the same manner and look at what happened to their economy and real estate market .
perhaps entire economies and individuals alike had better start embracing a more cash basis way of life ?
credit allows those to live above and beyond their means , a sort of false sense of having it all . - eugene via facebook the overvalued homes may not only be sinking in price due to the general economic state of ireland but also due to bad workmanship .
the place i rent is falling apart , cracks on walls and light bulbs hanging on a thread .
built in the boom and going out like a bang . - joel via facebook compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro what role do you think germany should play in stabilizing the eurozone ?
none !
dismantle the eu and the euro as quickly as possible before the entire eu ends up in one big , deep hole out of which there is no escape .
the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .
due to the expansion of the eu in jurisdiction and its administrative power , this has seemed to be sped through very quickly without much critical thinking to the point where it has may have overextended the whole project in its scope from what is practical . - philip , canada your article quoted herr heinemann , of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany , as saying , " does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ? "
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .
to employ an american idiom , europe is whistling past the graveyard on this issue . - michael , us ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections ireland is another country that proves that the euro can not succeed in practice . - davor , serbia cowen puts the burden on the back of families , students , workers , unemployed , health service , police and firefighters .
i wish there was an election to tell the politicians via bad language that they are traitors and gangsters to this country ...
the politicians are out of touch - they are living on the backs of the people . - michael , ireland germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax the irish republic must alter its budget so that all sectors contribute fairly .
it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .
many are little more than fly-by-nighters , who will simply move on when it looks like their activities will be put under the spotlight and seen as little more than shell companies who have contributed nothing to the nation . - roland , new zealand specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland is property in some european countries simply overvalued ?
this is mostly a result of easily attainable credit in the boom times .
another small country , iceland , also had credit access in the same manner and look at what happened to their economy and real estate market .
perhaps entire economies and individuals alike had better start embracing a more cash basis way of life ?
credit allows those to live above and beyond their means , a sort of false sense of having it all . - eugene via facebook the overvalued homes may not only be sinking in price due to the general economic state of ireland but also due to bad workmanship .
the place i rent is falling apart , cracks on walls and light bulbs hanging on a thread .
built in the boom and going out like a bang . - joel via facebook compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .

everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .

perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .

after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .

bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .

but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the wrist but it was n't the sight of his favorite social game being hijacked by a bunch of giddy , overpaid fools that so offended my brother - a man who does get frustrated with that sort of thing - it was that the journalist made a distinction between this and " the little image in his head " of normal , traditional boules , also known as petanque : a game for morose , alcoholic french pensioners in string vests and flat caps .
the truth about boules certainly , drink does flow at the boulodromes my brother regularly attends on the banks of berlin 's canals , and perhaps the over-60 's bracket is slightly better represented than in other sports .
but berlin 's boules scene is a happy mix of genders , ages and nationalities .
in fact , it is one of the few public spaces where ' old ' berlin - the city 's dwindling number of locally born residents - mingles freely with ' new ' berlin - the growing hordes of international , pleasure-seeking youth .
a life of leisure can be a great social glue .
the burdens of prejudice are lifted for long hours on those hallowed rectangles of gravel in the neighborhoods of kreuzberg , neukoelln and schoeneberg , and while inter-generational friendships are not exactly forged on a daily basis , one should not underestimate the brief moments of cultural exchange that spark when respectful nods pass between pistes in acknowledgement of a particularly successful boom shot .
no one is a professional , but everyone is united in what my brother calls " a joyful passion for the game . "
keeping steady boules is basically a pub-sport without a pub .
in lieu of a bar people bring their own alcohol and / or cannabis , and in the summers some enterprising locals set up a beer and bratwurst stand .
like all pub sports , the emphasis is on patience and accuracy , and so a moderate use of soft drugs is sometimes essential for attaining the requisite concentration and steadiness of hand .
of course , there are ' professional ' petanquists in the world who maintain strict regimes of abstention , but in berlin , a state of mild inebriation is de rigueur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game is suddenly cool again in europe not that the game is not organized here .
there are 10 official boules clubs in berlin , who run tournaments in designated areas around the city .
there is also an umbrella organization , the landes-petanque-verband berlin -lrb- lpvb -rrb- , which devises league tables and regulates local rules .
but berlin 's young , carefree recreational players have little to do with the serious boules world .
since this community has developed its game independently , with borrowed boules and little official input , there 's always a slight disconnect with the serious players .
their tactical vocabulary , for instance , is largely self-invented : where official strategists talk of pointing , shooting and the carreau -lrb- the three most common shots -rrb- my brother 's friends speak of " the boomer , " " the lobber " and " the dribbler , " or indeed the " dribble and pop " - when you roll the boule the entire length of the pitch and then it " pops , " or stops , right next to the jack , or , more properly named , the piglet .
also , boules has become an ideal way to deal with an attack of late-night insomnia , with many players bringing their own lamps for a night session .
so if you ever feel like hanging around the sinister areas down by the canals of treptow in the early hours of the morning , you may just chance upon my brother honing his dribble and pop .
ben knight 's little brother is a keen petanquist who lives within a dribble and pop of several boulodromes in the districts of kreuzberg , treptow and neukoelln .

but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

a side deal on forestry may be the most to hope for . deutsche welle spoke with connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action , about the prospects of making any real progress towards a treaty to tackle climate change at this year 's summit in cancun , mexico , which runs from november 29 to december 10 , 2010 .
deutsche welle : what are the priorities for the european union at the cancun talks ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions began rising in 2010 , following a slight fall in 2009 due to the economic crisis connie hedegaard : the main agenda for the european union is to get a balanced package of decisions coming out of cancun in order to keep momentum in the international climate negotiations , and to deliver on some of the pledges given by the leaders last year in copenhagen .
due to the lack of legislation coming through the american senate and due to the lack of progress in some other capitals , we can see that although the eu is ready , as we were last year in copenhagen , we will not get an internationally binding deal done by cancun .
but we can try to secure a set of decisions , for instance a framework for forestry .
we could have an agreement on an adaptation framework .
there was some substantial progress on both these issues in the formal negotiations in copenhagen .
we also ought to be able to agree on a framework of principles for how to cooperate on technology .
and , of course , the developed countries must deliver on their financial pledges from copenhagen .
it 's absolutely crucial that the thirty billion dollars promised in fast-start financing for this year , next year and 2012 are actually delivered .
on the subject of forestry , what are you aiming for and what do you think is realistic ?
we are aiming for an agreement that would turn the incentive structure around - for example , for the brazilian farmer , who , today , often has no other choice but to chop down the rainforest if he wants to have a plot where he can cultivate something he and his family can live from .
we want to change that so that in the future you can also gain something from protecting the rainforest , because that is in everybody 's interest .
on the subject of turning funding pledges into reality : what progress would you like to see this time that did n't come about before ?
if you ask the developing countries , they will say they have seen far too many international conferences where developed countries pledged this , that or the other , but they never saw the money coming their way in reality .
this time we must do better .
the developed countries as a group pledged to deliver around 30 billion dollars .
europe said we can account for around a third of that amount .
now when we come to cancun , we will prove that that is exactly what we are going to deliver .
the 27 member states and the commission together will deliver 7.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- and live up to our pledges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't expect much from the us , which did n't pass a climate bill in 2010 how do you see the position of a country like china ?
i think it is difficult to interpret the position of china .
i feel that china is very constructive when i have meetings with their ministers .
they are also very strong in defending the copenhagen accord .
but sometimes i hear signals of backtracking , and , to be honest , it 's a bit confusing .
i think it 's crucially important that china does not hide behind the lack of legislation in the us because china is such a huge player .
and the paradox is that there is so much that china is actually doing at home .
they are addressing energy efficiency and energy intensity , and they will be putting up new targets for renewable energy sources .
for the first time , they will probably have co2 emissions targets .
seen from a european perspective , it would also be preferable for them to engage strongly in the international negotiations .
for many developing countries , what china says is absolutely crucial . so we think it 's very important that they engage , as china is now the world 's biggest emitter .
some recent reports suggested that , although the eu has been successful on paper in reducing emissions , a lot of the emissions have been " exported , " because , in a country like china , for example , a lot of the emissions are caused by producing goods for export ?
it 's of course true that , since 1990 , a lot of our production in europe has been outsourced .
that 's also the reason why it 's so important to get a global deal .
you 're right that if we are just outsourcing production to those who are not part of an internationally binding deal , how much of the problem would we be solving ?
however , it does not change the fact that , in europe , we have also been improving in the field of energy efficiency . along with japan , we are the most energy efficient region of the world .
in our climate and energy package for 2020 , we have set a target of 20 percent renewable energy sources .
we are on track to reach that .
there was such massive disappointment after copenhagen that a lot of people do not have very high expectations for cancun .
do you think , against that background that something really can be achieved to take us further ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to commit to reductions in its emissions europe is working very hard to achieve an ambitious outcome from cancun .
yes , it looks difficult , but i think the sense of urgency should not be any less than prior to copenhagen .
because what has happened since ?
the climate has not improved . we have seen the hottest 12 months in a row ever recorded .
the chance remains with us .
we have to address it .
and for each year we postpone action , the more expensive and the more difficult it 's going to be in the end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 26.11.2010 demand for terrorism insurance grows after government warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's airports are insured by extremus extremus insures against terrorism damages over 25 million euros , limiting its coverage to airports , office towers and other huge investments .
recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .

" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.11.2010 ireland 's young professionals look to flee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 200,000 people are expected to emigrate by 2015 as ireland 's austerity measures bite , many of the country 's young businesspeople are considering leaving the country .
in fact , many have already left , looking for better prospects overseas . at a ' show your business week ' fair in the center of dublin , irish entrepreneurs have been showcasing their products and services , hoping to give their businesses a boost .
right in the middle of town , the exhibition gave these firms a prime spot to advertise .
but that wo n't be enough to change their fortunes as trading conditions in ireland have become incredibly difficult .
jimmy o 'reilly is one of them .
he has had to cut his workforce of laborers from eight to two at the small building firm he runs .
he has considered moving his business abroad .
but for now , he 's staying .
" unfortunately we have two kids here , and i 'm a bit loyal to ireland , " he said .
" i think we 'll stick with it and make an effort to keep it afloat . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the food industry , you move where the work is it 's easy for people to move their businesses within the european union , says neil barrett , who owns a food start-up .
" it 's a common market , so it 's as close to london as it is to cork , so you 'll move wherever it works .
because you have to . "
things are so bad , barrett says that it 's understandable that entrepreneurs would consider emigrating .
" this is a food business , and the food business is probably the toughest business around anyway , and this is probably the roughest year that any of us has ever lived through , and next year 's probably going to be worse . "
all talk ?
just how many people will up and leave ireland for better prospects elsewhere is impossible to say , but james wickham , a migration expert at trinity college dublin , says almost everyone is talking about it .
" it 's an absolutely standard thing for us in education to say , ' well all my students are talking about leaving . '
how many people have actually left is not clear , although it 's unambiguous that the number is rising .
there is a sort of general atmosphere of ' oh my god , i 'm getting out . '
" those statistics that are available suggest the numbers are already high .
according to the economic and social research institute , irish emigration jumped by 40 percent to 65,000 in the year to april 2010 .
it predicts 200,000 people will emigrate by 2015 .
student exodus the economic downturn in ireland is particularly worrying for students who wonder whether they will find jobs once they 've finished their studies .
ireland 's union of students predicts 150,000 young people will choose to leave the country to find work in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are expected to leave ireland in droves professor wickham says emigrating is not seen as a big deal by young irish people .
" this has happened before .
in the 1980s i can remember saying to my students ' last one out , turn out the light . '
" he pointed out that ireland , like poland , has for a long time been a country where " young people do n't think twice - or they think twice but not three times - before they emigrate . "
" we are a society where it is normal to leave .
if you talk to young germans in the middle of a recession - they do n't leave , " he said .
but wickham put a positive spin on the possibility of thousands of skilled workers leaving the country .
" one of the things we 've learnt from the last mass emigration is that people come back , and people travel backwards and forwards , " he said .
" the gains from emigration - from people coming back , from people setting up new concepts from business contacts , intellectual contacts , cultural contacts , professional contacts - you know those are real benefits . "

the jury is still out as to how dangerous bpa really is . beginning in 2011 , both the manufacture and sale of baby bottles containing the chemical bisphenol-a -lrb- bpa -rrb- will be banned across the european union , the european commission said on thursday .
" the decision … is good news for european parents who can be sure that as of mid-2011 plastic infant feeding bottles will not include bpa , " said john dalli , the commissioner in charge of health and consumer policy , in a statement .
from march 1 , 2011 , the manufacture of such bottles will be illegal within the eu , and from june 1 , 2011 , it will no longer be legal for bpa bottles produced abroad to be imported to the eu or sold on the european market .
how dangerous is bpa ?
bpa is widely used in plastic containers and packaging around the world .
although studies have linked bpa exposure to cancer , obesity and the early onset of puberty , its risks are still disputed .
the european food safety agency recently issued a report on the chemical , saying that it was safe in small quantities and yet admitting areas of uncertainty .
" it can not be excluded that there might be an effect on the development , immune response or tumor promotion , " dalli said in an october 7 statement .
france and denmark are the only two eu countries to already have a ban on bpa bottles in place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 26.11.2010 too cool for boules - berlin 's petanquists spin the metal balls their way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boules is cool again , or so they say , with registered clubs mushrooming all over france and the uk .
but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the wrist but it was n't the sight of his favorite social game being hijacked by a bunch of giddy , overpaid fools that so offended my brother - a man who does get frustrated with that sort of thing - it was that the journalist made a distinction between this and " the little image in his head " of normal , traditional boules , also known as petanque : a game for morose , alcoholic french pensioners in string vests and flat caps .
the truth about boules certainly , drink does flow at the boulodromes my brother regularly attends on the banks of berlin 's canals , and perhaps the over-60 's bracket is slightly better represented than in other sports .
but berlin 's boules scene is a happy mix of genders , ages and nationalities .
in fact , it is one of the few public spaces where ' old ' berlin - the city 's dwindling number of locally born residents - mingles freely with ' new ' berlin - the growing hordes of international , pleasure-seeking youth .
a life of leisure can be a great social glue .
the burdens of prejudice are lifted for long hours on those hallowed rectangles of gravel in the neighborhoods of kreuzberg , neukoelln and schoeneberg , and while inter-generational friendships are not exactly forged on a daily basis , one should not underestimate the brief moments of cultural exchange that spark when respectful nods pass between pistes in acknowledgement of a particularly successful boom shot .
no one is a professional , but everyone is united in what my brother calls " a joyful passion for the game . "
keeping steady boules is basically a pub-sport without a pub .
in lieu of a bar people bring their own alcohol and / or cannabis , and in the summers some enterprising locals set up a beer and bratwurst stand .
like all pub sports , the emphasis is on patience and accuracy , and so a moderate use of soft drugs is sometimes essential for attaining the requisite concentration and steadiness of hand .
of course , there are ' professional ' petanquists in the world who maintain strict regimes of abstention , but in berlin , a state of mild inebriation is de rigueur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game is suddenly cool again in europe not that the game is not organized here .
there are 10 official boules clubs in berlin , who run tournaments in designated areas around the city .
there is also an umbrella organization , the landes-petanque-verband berlin -lrb- lpvb -rrb- , which devises league tables and regulates local rules .
but berlin 's young , carefree recreational players have little to do with the serious boules world .
since this community has developed its game independently , with borrowed boules and little official input , there 's always a slight disconnect with the serious players .
their tactical vocabulary , for instance , is largely self-invented : where official strategists talk of pointing , shooting and the carreau -lrb- the three most common shots -rrb- my brother 's friends speak of " the boomer , " " the lobber " and " the dribbler , " or indeed the " dribble and pop " - when you roll the boule the entire length of the pitch and then it " pops , " or stops , right next to the jack , or , more properly named , the piglet .
also , boules has become an ideal way to deal with an attack of late-night insomnia , with many players bringing their own lamps for a night session .
so if you ever feel like hanging around the sinister areas down by the canals of treptow in the early hours of the morning , you may just chance upon my brother honing his dribble and pop .
ben knight 's little brother is a keen petanquist who lives within a dribble and pop of several boulodromes in the districts of kreuzberg , treptow and neukoelln .

men have twice the rate of leukemia and women have three times the rate of thyroid cancer . newly published figures from the lower saxony state cancer registry show that in the area around asse , the site of a controversial nuclear waste dump near wolffenbuettel , some cancer rates are higher than normal . between 2002 and 2009 there were 12 cases of leukemia in the greater asse region .
the area had twice the rate expected for men .
while there was no significant increase in leukemia for women , their rate of thyroid cancer was three times as high as normal . the government has not yet determined if the increase is related to the proximity to the nuclear waste site .
a working group of representatives from lower saxony ’ s environment , social , and health ministries as well as the federal agency for radiation protection is set to meet over the next few weeks to take a closer look at the data . joerg roehmann , the district administrator in wolfenbuettel , said in an interview with german public television that the numbers needed to be analyzed and put into context before any conclusions can be made . " i 'd like to appeal to anyone from this area who has been diagnosed with leukemia , for example , to come forward , along with doctors or anyone treating these patients to help us make comparisons and create a context for this data , " he said . " we do n't know anything about exact location , age , occupation , or family history in these cases . " no blame yet asse was originally a salt mine .
between 1967 and 1978 around 126,000 drums of waste were stored in the facility .
more recently it 's been declared unstable because of a danger of collapse and water leaks and is due to be emptied out and shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is stored in a former salt mine ursula kleber is on the board of directors of a non-profit organization called aufpassen , a play on words with asse and the german word ' aufpassen , ' meaning ' to take care of . ' aufpassen addresses problems and concerns relating to the site . " because of asse , we 're pretty nervous around here , " kleber told deutsche welle " so it 's good that this investigation is taking place .
but we do n't have enough information yet to say this was caused by asse . " statistical variance while the exact cause of the higher leukemia and thyroid cancer rates are being examined , it is important to note that the actual number of cases reported is relatively small . in the seven years covered in the newly released statistics , 12 cases of leukemia in men were reported from the greater asse area .
the average is five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radiation levels are carefully monitored at asse dr. stefanie seltmann from the german cancer research center in heidelberg told deutsche welle that these numbers are not necessarily cause for alarm . " if you assume that there are about 10,000 small communities like this in germany , " she said , " then strictly from a standpoint of statistical variation , if five cases is average , some communities will have 12 while others wo n't have any , without any particular reason such as radiation . " it is slightly more concerning that in every year surveyed this statistical variation existed , but dr. seltmann says it could all turn out to be just a coincidence . with such a small sample group , definitive answers will have to wait a few more weeks for the conclusion of the working group in lower saxony . author : matt zuvela , holly fox -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new delhi accused islamabad of failing in its promise to punish the alleged masterminds . when gunmen targeted india 's financial hub and symbol of the country ’ s economic rise on november 26 2008 , the media were quick to describe the carefully-orchestrated attacks as india ’ s " 9/11 . "
they soon became known as india ’ s " 26/11 . "
two years later , the wounds have not healed , says security expert afsar karim in new delhi : " this is because those behind the attacks have not yet been brought to justice .
the threat , which emanates from pakistan , has not lessened because pakistan has not acted against the terror groups which operated from its territory .
a wound can only heal if there is no danger that something like this will be repeated . " bildunterschrift : gunmen assailed mumbai 's victoria central station and several other buildings on " 26/11 " the attacks did little to improve the already tense relations between india and pakistan .
the only surviving gunman ajmal amir kasab , who is pakistani , has said that the officially banned pakistan-based terror group , lashkar-e-taiba , was behind the bloodbath . new delhi has accused islamabad of being slow to look into the cause of the attacks and of conducting its investigation half-heartedly .
lashkar-e-taiba and its head hafiz saeed are thought to have close connections to pakistan 's secret services . delhi claims the highest circles in pakistan must have been aware of the plans to attack mumbai . better relations needed between india and pakistan " i am one of those who think it is important for the whole region that india and pakistan have good relations , " says amitabh mattoo , a political expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university . " for india as an aspiring nation it is very important to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors .
four years ago , there were some good talks with pakistan under former president musharraf and many thought this might lead to a breakthrough . " but after the mumbai attacks , india wanted pakistan to act against lashkar-e-taiba and yet the founders are still running free , holding speeches all over the country .
if the pakistani government doesn ’ t change its attitude , the instability will go on . " slow implementation of reforms after the attacks , the indian government announced it would invest more in security and prevention .
police reforms were introduced and the media , which were accused of playing into the hands of the terrorists with their reporting , agreed to act according to a code of honor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian home minister p. chidambaram paid tribute to the victims on the second anniversary they said that they would censor themselves at times of crisis and not talk about security plans for instance . " there have been reforms but these have perhaps not been implemented as fast as we would have liked , " explained afsar karim . " the reforms could help to gather more information about terrorist activities inside india .
but activities outside of india can not be prevented .
if the problem of terrorism is not tackled at its root there could be hundreds of new targets and we wo n't be able to do anything against the threat . " in response to india 's repeated criticism , pakistan 's foreign minister said on friday that it was the government 's " desire to punish those involved " in the mumbai attacks . author : priya esselborn editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 26.11.2010 eu sets sights low for climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's climate chief thinks agreements are possible on some things , but not a treaty in the wake of last year 's underwhelming result in copenhagen , the european union is going into the climate talks in cancun with few expectations .
a side deal on forestry may be the most to hope for . deutsche welle spoke with connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action , about the prospects of making any real progress towards a treaty to tackle climate change at this year 's summit in cancun , mexico , which runs from november 29 to december 10 , 2010 .
deutsche welle : what are the priorities for the european union at the cancun talks ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions began rising in 2010 , following a slight fall in 2009 due to the economic crisis connie hedegaard : the main agenda for the european union is to get a balanced package of decisions coming out of cancun in order to keep momentum in the international climate negotiations , and to deliver on some of the pledges given by the leaders last year in copenhagen .
due to the lack of legislation coming through the american senate and due to the lack of progress in some other capitals , we can see that although the eu is ready , as we were last year in copenhagen , we will not get an internationally binding deal done by cancun .
but we can try to secure a set of decisions , for instance a framework for forestry .
we could have an agreement on an adaptation framework .
there was some substantial progress on both these issues in the formal negotiations in copenhagen .
we also ought to be able to agree on a framework of principles for how to cooperate on technology .
and , of course , the developed countries must deliver on their financial pledges from copenhagen .
it 's absolutely crucial that the thirty billion dollars promised in fast-start financing for this year , next year and 2012 are actually delivered .
on the subject of forestry , what are you aiming for and what do you think is realistic ?
we are aiming for an agreement that would turn the incentive structure around - for example , for the brazilian farmer , who , today , often has no other choice but to chop down the rainforest if he wants to have a plot where he can cultivate something he and his family can live from .
we want to change that so that in the future you can also gain something from protecting the rainforest , because that is in everybody 's interest .
on the subject of turning funding pledges into reality : what progress would you like to see this time that did n't come about before ?
if you ask the developing countries , they will say they have seen far too many international conferences where developed countries pledged this , that or the other , but they never saw the money coming their way in reality .
this time we must do better .
the developed countries as a group pledged to deliver around 30 billion dollars .
europe said we can account for around a third of that amount .
now when we come to cancun , we will prove that that is exactly what we are going to deliver .
the 27 member states and the commission together will deliver 7.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- and live up to our pledges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't expect much from the us , which did n't pass a climate bill in 2010 how do you see the position of a country like china ?
i think it is difficult to interpret the position of china .
i feel that china is very constructive when i have meetings with their ministers .
they are also very strong in defending the copenhagen accord .
but sometimes i hear signals of backtracking , and , to be honest , it 's a bit confusing .
i think it 's crucially important that china does not hide behind the lack of legislation in the us because china is such a huge player .
and the paradox is that there is so much that china is actually doing at home .
they are addressing energy efficiency and energy intensity , and they will be putting up new targets for renewable energy sources .
for the first time , they will probably have co2 emissions targets .
seen from a european perspective , it would also be preferable for them to engage strongly in the international negotiations .
for many developing countries , what china says is absolutely crucial . so we think it 's very important that they engage , as china is now the world 's biggest emitter .
some recent reports suggested that , although the eu has been successful on paper in reducing emissions , a lot of the emissions have been " exported , " because , in a country like china , for example , a lot of the emissions are caused by producing goods for export ?
it 's of course true that , since 1990 , a lot of our production in europe has been outsourced .
that 's also the reason why it 's so important to get a global deal .
you 're right that if we are just outsourcing production to those who are not part of an internationally binding deal , how much of the problem would we be solving ?
however , it does not change the fact that , in europe , we have also been improving in the field of energy efficiency . along with japan , we are the most energy efficient region of the world .
in our climate and energy package for 2020 , we have set a target of 20 percent renewable energy sources .
we are on track to reach that .
there was such massive disappointment after copenhagen that a lot of people do not have very high expectations for cancun .
do you think , against that background that something really can be achieved to take us further ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to commit to reductions in its emissions europe is working very hard to achieve an ambitious outcome from cancun .
yes , it looks difficult , but i think the sense of urgency should not be any less than prior to copenhagen .
because what has happened since ?
the climate has not improved . we have seen the hottest 12 months in a row ever recorded .
the chance remains with us .
we have to address it .
and for each year we postpone action , the more expensive and the more difficult it 's going to be in the end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

a side deal on forestry may be the most to hope for . deutsche welle spoke with connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action , about the prospects of making any real progress towards a treaty to tackle climate change at this year 's summit in cancun , mexico , which runs from november 29 to december 10 , 2010 .
deutsche welle : what are the priorities for the european union at the cancun talks ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions began rising in 2010 , following a slight fall in 2009 due to the economic crisis connie hedegaard : the main agenda for the european union is to get a balanced package of decisions coming out of cancun in order to keep momentum in the international climate negotiations , and to deliver on some of the pledges given by the leaders last year in copenhagen .
due to the lack of legislation coming through the american senate and due to the lack of progress in some other capitals , we can see that although the eu is ready , as we were last year in copenhagen , we will not get an internationally binding deal done by cancun .
but we can try to secure a set of decisions , for instance a framework for forestry .
we could have an agreement on an adaptation framework .
there was some substantial progress on both these issues in the formal negotiations in copenhagen .
we also ought to be able to agree on a framework of principles for how to cooperate on technology .
and , of course , the developed countries must deliver on their financial pledges from copenhagen .
it 's absolutely crucial that the thirty billion dollars promised in fast-start financing for this year , next year and 2012 are actually delivered .
on the subject of forestry , what are you aiming for and what do you think is realistic ?
we are aiming for an agreement that would turn the incentive structure around - for example , for the brazilian farmer , who , today , often has no other choice but to chop down the rainforest if he wants to have a plot where he can cultivate something he and his family can live from .
we want to change that so that in the future you can also gain something from protecting the rainforest , because that is in everybody 's interest .
on the subject of turning funding pledges into reality : what progress would you like to see this time that did n't come about before ?
if you ask the developing countries , they will say they have seen far too many international conferences where developed countries pledged this , that or the other , but they never saw the money coming their way in reality .
this time we must do better .
the developed countries as a group pledged to deliver around 30 billion dollars .
europe said we can account for around a third of that amount .
now when we come to cancun , we will prove that that is exactly what we are going to deliver .
the 27 member states and the commission together will deliver 7.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- and live up to our pledges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't expect much from the us , which did n't pass a climate bill in 2010 how do you see the position of a country like china ?
i think it is difficult to interpret the position of china .
i feel that china is very constructive when i have meetings with their ministers .
they are also very strong in defending the copenhagen accord .
but sometimes i hear signals of backtracking , and , to be honest , it 's a bit confusing .
i think it 's crucially important that china does not hide behind the lack of legislation in the us because china is such a huge player .
and the paradox is that there is so much that china is actually doing at home .
they are addressing energy efficiency and energy intensity , and they will be putting up new targets for renewable energy sources .
for the first time , they will probably have co2 emissions targets .
seen from a european perspective , it would also be preferable for them to engage strongly in the international negotiations .
for many developing countries , what china says is absolutely crucial . so we think it 's very important that they engage , as china is now the world 's biggest emitter .
some recent reports suggested that , although the eu has been successful on paper in reducing emissions , a lot of the emissions have been " exported , " because , in a country like china , for example , a lot of the emissions are caused by producing goods for export ?
it 's of course true that , since 1990 , a lot of our production in europe has been outsourced .
that 's also the reason why it 's so important to get a global deal .
you 're right that if we are just outsourcing production to those who are not part of an internationally binding deal , how much of the problem would we be solving ?
however , it does not change the fact that , in europe , we have also been improving in the field of energy efficiency . along with japan , we are the most energy efficient region of the world .
in our climate and energy package for 2020 , we have set a target of 20 percent renewable energy sources .
we are on track to reach that .
there was such massive disappointment after copenhagen that a lot of people do not have very high expectations for cancun .
do you think , against that background that something really can be achieved to take us further ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to commit to reductions in its emissions europe is working very hard to achieve an ambitious outcome from cancun .
yes , it looks difficult , but i think the sense of urgency should not be any less than prior to copenhagen .
because what has happened since ?
the climate has not improved . we have seen the hottest 12 months in a row ever recorded .
the chance remains with us .
we have to address it .
and for each year we postpone action , the more expensive and the more difficult it 's going to be in the end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint elections -pipe- 26.11.2010 problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haitians are attracted more by candidates than parties battered by earthquakes and cholera , haiti desperately needs stability .
the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 stealthy leverkusen reaps the rewards of hiding in plain sight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are making a low-key assault on the summit there have been so many surprises so far this season that the bundesliga is in no short supply of media darlings .
bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

the divided korean peninsula has provided every sitting us president with a dilemma ever since dwight eisenhower brokered an armistice in the korean war .
that act paused but did not officially end a conflict which had raged for almost three years and cost some 36,000 american lives .
due to the fact that no official peace deal was agreed 58 years ago , the two koreas have been living under the shadow of a potential return to war ever since eisenhower 's intervention .
america 's involvement in the war that divided korea along the 38th parallel also continues to this day due to the commitment of the us to protect south korea from any aggression by its communist neighbors in the north .
around 29,000 us troops remain deployed in south korea .
presidents johnson , ford and carter all had run-ins with north korea during their times in office while the more contemporary administrations of bill clinton and both bush presidencies have had to deal with the north 's growing nuclear ambitions .
while skirmishes in the seas around the korean peninsula and small scale attacks on land gave the immediate post-war presidents a real headache , the last three us leaders have found that the increasingly unpredictable north , with its now indisputable yet crude nuclear weapons , has become a completely different problem .
but while the nature of its threat has changed , the question as to how best to deal with north korea endures .
several experts quoted in european media said they believed the north only developed its nuclear program as leverage .
it was a way of blackmailing the west into concessions on sanctions and aid .
but white house incumbents have so far chosen not to find out whether the north 's regime is prepared to use its arsenal as more than just a bargaining chip .
while the shelling of yeonpyeong island by the north and the responding fire from the south on tuesday was the most serious exchange between the two koreas in over a year - the disputed sinking of the south 's corvette " cheonan " in march aside - this incident is just the latest in a long line of skirmishes .
however , the bombing of yeonpyeong comes just a week after the north revealed a nuclear enrichment facility to a group of american scientists so advanced that it shocked the us .
north 's nuclear capability changes complexion of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any military action would likely come from the south president obama is honor-bound to protect south korea , as his predecessors have been , and as such has strongly affirmed his commitment to defend it as part of the alliance which stretches back to the korean war .
the nuclear-powered uss washington aircraft carrier was deployed to the yellow sea off the coast of south korea on wednesday .
but with north korea 's nuclear capability more advanced than first thought , the us president is unwilling to provoke any escalation and has chosen not to reposition any of the 29,000 us troops in the south closer to the de-militarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- .
obama 's options are limited , said glyn ford , a north east asia specialist and author .
many consider it highly unlikely that the us will engage in any military action against the north , partly because of its nuclear capability and partly because it has a huge army of 9.45 million troops .
if the us commitment to south korea 's defense is to be invoked , it will most likely come in the form of support , not direct intervention .
" the military option is still on the table for the us but we 're a long way off from that , " ford told deutsche welle .
ford said records showed that the us was planning preemptive strikes on the north 's nuclear facilities back in 1994 , so this had been considered before .
but the us was not keen to engage in this and has pulled its troops back further into the south .
" if things do escalate , however , it would be easier if it was the south koreans who took the initiative , backed up by us hardware , " ford said .
" it is very unlikely the us would commit ground troops and its umbrella protection policy would probably only stretch to supporting south korean forces . "
sanctions and the freezing of assets also seem to have little effect on the regime given that pyongyang exists largely outside the system of international financial and diplomatic institutions - unlike countries like iran , which have been subject to us pressure through economic channels .
us unlikely to stage attacks in china 's backyard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to maintain friendly relations with china the us is also unlikely to want to anger china , north korea 's only international ally and economic supporter .
while china has called for restraint on the korean peninsula , beijing has refused to issue an outright condemnation of the bombing of yeonpyeong , even as veiled calls to do so from the united states and japan began to circulate .
however , while beijing remains outwardly supportive , it is thought that china is far from happy with the actions of its disruptive neighbor .
" china will actually be quite upset with north korea over this latest incident so the chinese would n't mind seeing north korea punished for this , " said ford .
" however , it is unlikely that they would protest too much if it was the south koreans who retaliated but it would be a different matter if the united states got involved .
that would be quite problematic . "
howard loewen , an asia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said china played a vital role in the current diplomatic initiative together with the us and south korea that aimed at reviving the six-party talks with north korea instead of engaging in a military conflict . " yet , if hostilities should increase and if south korea would ask for american help , the us would be obliged to defend korea , " loewen told deutsche welle .
" the us would thus interfere to stabilize a destabilized region .
the reaction of china to such a move would depend on its diplomatic interaction with the us and south korea beforehand . " still , loewen said he did not think that the united efforts by china , the us and south korea would be fruitless . " due to significant economic interdependencies , all the major players in the region will put all their efforts into a peaceful solution of the current crisis , " he said .
asian expectations put pressure on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's threat could force the south to act alone in its role as a counterweight to chinese power in the region , any reaffirmation of us commitment , even through diplomatic means , could have a galvanizing effect on america 's asian allies .
" the asian allies expect the us to act as a smooth and diplomatic balance toward china 's rise in the region , " said loewen . " underlining its commitment to south korea shows the other allies that they can rely on the us .
if a war situation emerges , the actual us engagement will depend on the interaction of the major powers in the region and us domestic politics . "
but with the us unlikely to take military action against north korea , some experts believe that its commitment toward its allies in asia may be seen by some countries as wavering .
the knock-on effect on regional stability could be just as damaging in the long term as an air strike .
both south korea and japan have long been opposed to developing their own nuclear weapons , despite the threat emanating from north korea , instead relying on their conventional forces and us commitments to their defense .
should the us weigh up the myriad potential problems arising from launching strikes on north korea and chose to pursue different routes , some experts say south korea and even japan - the victim of two nuclear strikes at the end of world war ii - would reconsider their position .
" korean and japanese plans of going it alone in this respect have always been mitigated by the us government , " loewen said .
" surely , if the conflict between the two koreas would escalate and no american support would follow , both states would consider other defensive options .
however , this is not very likely . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tiger , tiger , burning bright / in the forests of the night , / what immortal hand or eye / could frame thy fearful symmetry ? "
the 18th century english poet william blake had written .
two centuries later , the brightest flame of the world 's forests is flickering and is on the point of extinction .
russian prime minister vladimir putin and chinese premier wen jiabao were in st. petersburg in russia to attend the first summit to save the world 's last wild tigers , numbering a mere 3,200 now , down from 100,000 a century ago .
the call by russia 's strongman vladimir putin to world leaders to save the tiger came exactly at the right time : " it 's not just about the tiger .
we , the heads of state and of governments , must understand how imporant it is preserve nature , " he said .
chinese premier wen jiabao was equally unequivocal : " we must react , work together and decide on concrete steps to save the tiger . "
the magic formula bildunterschrift : the siberian tiger volker holmes , the director of species conservation at the worldwide fund for nature , germany , attended the four-day summit .
' double the number , ' seems to have been the magic formula , he explains : " the heads of state and governments decided on the global tiger recovery program , which is something like an action plan that will make sure in the coming 12 years , until the next year of the tiger in 2022 , that the tiger population is able to double .
and the second decision was a declaration by the heads of state , which is somehow the umbrella for the action plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south china tiger the action plan will concentrate on preserving and improving the tiger 's habitat by preventing poaching and deforestation .
financial commitments to the extent of $ 350 million were made .
" it will be important that these countries , the range countries meet , including the donor countries and donor organizations .
and for example , during the next 12 years that they have succeeding meetings to monitor what has happened , what is possible , are there still funding gaps open for immediate action and so on , " holmes added regarding monitoring .
the tiger 's foes ...
bildunterschrift : the indonesian tiger ravi singh , head of wwf in india , pointed out that the tiger 's enemies were well known : " basically there are three : one is the illegal trade in not just tiger , but the killing of its prey .
the second important issue is the fact that there is a lot of human conflict at the peripheries of these areas .
and the third is the fragmentation of habitat .
the land space for tigers is actually decreasing . "
and friends but he was more optimistic regarding the outcome of the st. petersburg summit : " the tiger forum brought to the fore fairly firm statements by leading political leaders of several nations ... has sent out a fairly good message to the world in terms of the importance of conservation and highlighting the issue of the tiger .
in our -lrb- wwf 's -rrb- view , the ability to influence political leadership and the ability to influence the direction of economic and financial support to some of the conservation and the projects which are happening on the ground is very very important . "
india 's legendary tiger shikari jim corbett once described the tiger as " a large-hearted gentleman with boundless courage " .
he already warned about tiger 's extermination back in the middle of the 20th century .
let us see whether we can prevent such a tragedy in the 21st .

the warning comes days after four people were killed when north korean shells rained down on a south korean island . as if to prove that its threats are far from empty , north korea reportedly staged a firing drill on friday near the border with south korea . a south korean defense ministry spokesman said that explosions had been heard for about three hours in the early afternoon and they appeared to be from the north . there were no details about where the shells had landed but the exercise and north korea 's latest warnings sent a chill across south korea 's outposts . bildunterschrift : many inhabitants have now left yeonpyeong for the mainland their fear is not unfounded considering tuesday 's deadly attack on the tiny fishing and garrison island of yeonpyeong that killed four people , including two civilians , and wounded 18 more .
dozens of houses were reduced to rubble . the island , parts of which now resemble a warzone according to reports , has apparently emptied .
there are mainly troops and local officials left . islanders on other more distant outposts , such as baengnyeong near the spot where the south korean cheonan warship was sunk in march , fear they could be next . many residents have already tried to escape by taking crowded ferries to the mainland .
some were reportedly not able to buy tickets as the boats were fully booked . those who have to stay behind have stocked up on supplies such as water , instant food , blankets and candles . new defense minister in seoul a us aircraft carrier group is being sent to the yellow sea to join south korea 's navy for a four-day joint exercise that is set to start on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of houses were reduced to rubble but pyongyang warned on friday that north korea 's army would bring down " a shower of dreadful fire " if its enemies encroach upon its " dignity and sovereignty even in the least . " one of the first tasks of south korea ’ s new defense minister , kim kwan-jin , a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appointed on friday , will be to decide upon how to react to any future provocation . on thursday , south korean defense minister kim tae-young resigned after coming under fire for the army ’ s apparently slow response to tuesday ’ s attack . the south fired 80 shells at the north 's coastal artillery positions but it did not call in air strikes , apparently to avoid increasing the tension even more . " we suspect that the north sustained considerable damage , " a south korean military official said . the south has since decided to send in more troops and guns to five frontline islands and has said it will change the rules of engagement so that the military can hit back harder in case of future attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the son of kim oh-bock , right , was killed in the attack on tuesday hard-liners call for harsher response hard-line protesters in south korea 's capital have been calling on the government to react with more force to pyongyang in general . " we should not be scared of the enemy , " one demonstrator said .
" our people has to be unified so that we can fight back with full force .
conservative groups like us and the older generation that remembers the korean war have come here to show our solidarity . " however , other more left-wing south koreans say that president lee myung-bak ’ s hard-line attitude over the past two years is to blame for the current tension on the korean peninsula . act / afp / reuters / dpa editor : manasi gopalakrishnan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the divided korean peninsula has provided every sitting us president with a dilemma ever since dwight eisenhower brokered an armistice in the korean war .
that act paused but did not officially end a conflict which had raged for almost three years and cost some 36,000 american lives .
due to the fact that no official peace deal was agreed 58 years ago , the two koreas have been living under the shadow of a potential return to war ever since eisenhower 's intervention .
america 's involvement in the war that divided korea along the 38th parallel also continues to this day due to the commitment of the us to protect south korea from any aggression by its communist neighbors in the north .
around 29,000 us troops remain deployed in south korea .
presidents johnson , ford and carter all had run-ins with north korea during their times in office while the more contemporary administrations of bill clinton and both bush presidencies have had to deal with the north 's growing nuclear ambitions .
while skirmishes in the seas around the korean peninsula and small scale attacks on land gave the immediate post-war presidents a real headache , the last three us leaders have found that the increasingly unpredictable north , with its now indisputable yet crude nuclear weapons , has become a completely different problem .
but while the nature of its threat has changed , the question as to how best to deal with north korea endures .
several experts quoted in european media said they believed the north only developed its nuclear program as leverage .
it was a way of blackmailing the west into concessions on sanctions and aid .
but white house incumbents have so far chosen not to find out whether the north 's regime is prepared to use its arsenal as more than just a bargaining chip .
while the shelling of yeonpyeong island by the north and the responding fire from the south on tuesday was the most serious exchange between the two koreas in over a year - the disputed sinking of the south 's corvette " cheonan " in march aside - this incident is just the latest in a long line of skirmishes .
however , the bombing of yeonpyeong comes just a week after the north revealed a nuclear enrichment facility to a group of american scientists so advanced that it shocked the us .
north 's nuclear capability changes complexion of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any military action would likely come from the south president obama is honor-bound to protect south korea , as his predecessors have been , and as such has strongly affirmed his commitment to defend it as part of the alliance which stretches back to the korean war .
the nuclear-powered uss washington aircraft carrier was deployed to the yellow sea off the coast of south korea on wednesday .
but with north korea 's nuclear capability more advanced than first thought , the us president is unwilling to provoke any escalation and has chosen not to reposition any of the 29,000 us troops in the south closer to the de-militarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- .
obama 's options are limited , said glyn ford , a north east asia specialist and author .
many consider it highly unlikely that the us will engage in any military action against the north , partly because of its nuclear capability and partly because it has a huge army of 9.45 million troops .
if the us commitment to south korea 's defense is to be invoked , it will most likely come in the form of support , not direct intervention .
" the military option is still on the table for the us but we 're a long way off from that , " ford told deutsche welle .
ford said records showed that the us was planning preemptive strikes on the north 's nuclear facilities back in 1994 , so this had been considered before .
but the us was not keen to engage in this and has pulled its troops back further into the south .
" if things do escalate , however , it would be easier if it was the south koreans who took the initiative , backed up by us hardware , " ford said .
" it is very unlikely the us would commit ground troops and its umbrella protection policy would probably only stretch to supporting south korean forces . "
sanctions and the freezing of assets also seem to have little effect on the regime given that pyongyang exists largely outside the system of international financial and diplomatic institutions - unlike countries like iran , which have been subject to us pressure through economic channels .
us unlikely to stage attacks in china 's backyard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to maintain friendly relations with china the us is also unlikely to want to anger china , north korea 's only international ally and economic supporter .
while china has called for restraint on the korean peninsula , beijing has refused to issue an outright condemnation of the bombing of yeonpyeong , even as veiled calls to do so from the united states and japan began to circulate .
however , while beijing remains outwardly supportive , it is thought that china is far from happy with the actions of its disruptive neighbor .
" china will actually be quite upset with north korea over this latest incident so the chinese would n't mind seeing north korea punished for this , " said ford .
" however , it is unlikely that they would protest too much if it was the south koreans who retaliated but it would be a different matter if the united states got involved .
that would be quite problematic . "
howard loewen , an asia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said china played a vital role in the current diplomatic initiative together with the us and south korea that aimed at reviving the six-party talks with north korea instead of engaging in a military conflict . " yet , if hostilities should increase and if south korea would ask for american help , the us would be obliged to defend korea , " loewen told deutsche welle .
" the us would thus interfere to stabilize a destabilized region .
the reaction of china to such a move would depend on its diplomatic interaction with the us and south korea beforehand . " still , loewen said he did not think that the united efforts by china , the us and south korea would be fruitless . " due to significant economic interdependencies , all the major players in the region will put all their efforts into a peaceful solution of the current crisis , " he said .

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

while china has called for restraint on the korean peninsula , beijing has refused to issue an outright condemnation of the bombing of yeonpyeong , even as veiled calls to do so from the united states and japan began to circulate .
however , while beijing remains outwardly supportive , it is thought that china is far from happy with the actions of its disruptive neighbor .
" china will actually be quite upset with north korea over this latest incident so the chinese would n't mind seeing north korea punished for this , " said ford .
" however , it is unlikely that they would protest too much if it was the south koreans who retaliated but it would be a different matter if the united states got involved .
that would be quite problematic . "
howard loewen , an asia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said china played a vital role in the current diplomatic initiative together with the us and south korea that aimed at reviving the six-party talks with north korea instead of engaging in a military conflict . " yet , if hostilities should increase and if south korea would ask for american help , the us would be obliged to defend korea , " loewen told deutsche welle .
" the us would thus interfere to stabilize a destabilized region .
the reaction of china to such a move would depend on its diplomatic interaction with the us and south korea beforehand . " still , loewen said he did not think that the united efforts by china , the us and south korea would be fruitless . " due to significant economic interdependencies , all the major players in the region will put all their efforts into a peaceful solution of the current crisis , " he said .
asian expectations put pressure on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's threat could force the south to act alone in its role as a counterweight to chinese power in the region , any reaffirmation of us commitment , even through diplomatic means , could have a galvanizing effect on america 's asian allies .
" the asian allies expect the us to act as a smooth and diplomatic balance toward china 's rise in the region , " said loewen . " underlining its commitment to south korea shows the other allies that they can rely on the us .
if a war situation emerges , the actual us engagement will depend on the interaction of the major powers in the region and us domestic politics . "
but with the us unlikely to take military action against north korea , some experts believe that its commitment toward its allies in asia may be seen by some countries as wavering .
the knock-on effect on regional stability could be just as damaging in the long term as an air strike .
both south korea and japan have long been opposed to developing their own nuclear weapons , despite the threat emanating from north korea , instead relying on their conventional forces and us commitments to their defense .
should the us weigh up the myriad potential problems arising from launching strikes on north korea and chose to pursue different routes , some experts say south korea and even japan - the victim of two nuclear strikes at the end of world war ii - would reconsider their position .
" korean and japanese plans of going it alone in this respect have always been mitigated by the us government , " loewen said .
" surely , if the conflict between the two koreas would escalate and no american support would follow , both states would consider other defensive options .
however , this is not very likely . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the wrist but it was n't the sight of his favorite social game being hijacked by a bunch of giddy , overpaid fools that so offended my brother - a man who does get frustrated with that sort of thing - it was that the journalist made a distinction between this and " the little image in his head " of normal , traditional boules , also known as petanque : a game for morose , alcoholic french pensioners in string vests and flat caps .
the truth about boules certainly , drink does flow at the boulodromes my brother regularly attends on the banks of berlin 's canals , and perhaps the over-60 's bracket is slightly better represented than in other sports .
but berlin 's boules scene is a happy mix of genders , ages and nationalities .
in fact , it is one of the few public spaces where ' old ' berlin - the city 's dwindling number of locally born residents - mingles freely with ' new ' berlin - the growing hordes of international , pleasure-seeking youth .
a life of leisure can be a great social glue .
the burdens of prejudice are lifted for long hours on those hallowed rectangles of gravel in the neighborhoods of kreuzberg , neukoelln and schoeneberg , and while inter-generational friendships are not exactly forged on a daily basis , one should not underestimate the brief moments of cultural exchange that spark when respectful nods pass between pistes in acknowledgement of a particularly successful boom shot .
no one is a professional , but everyone is united in what my brother calls " a joyful passion for the game . "
keeping steady boules is basically a pub-sport without a pub .
in lieu of a bar people bring their own alcohol and / or cannabis , and in the summers some enterprising locals set up a beer and bratwurst stand .
like all pub sports , the emphasis is on patience and accuracy , and so a moderate use of soft drugs is sometimes essential for attaining the requisite concentration and steadiness of hand .
of course , there are ' professional ' petanquists in the world who maintain strict regimes of abstention , but in berlin , a state of mild inebriation is de rigueur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game is suddenly cool again in europe not that the game is not organized here .
there are 10 official boules clubs in berlin , who run tournaments in designated areas around the city .
there is also an umbrella organization , the landes-petanque-verband berlin -lrb- lpvb -rrb- , which devises league tables and regulates local rules .
but berlin 's young , carefree recreational players have little to do with the serious boules world .
since this community has developed its game independently , with borrowed boules and little official input , there 's always a slight disconnect with the serious players .
their tactical vocabulary , for instance , is largely self-invented : where official strategists talk of pointing , shooting and the carreau -lrb- the three most common shots -rrb- my brother 's friends speak of " the boomer , " " the lobber " and " the dribbler , " or indeed the " dribble and pop " - when you roll the boule the entire length of the pitch and then it " pops , " or stops , right next to the jack , or , more properly named , the piglet .
also , boules has become an ideal way to deal with an attack of late-night insomnia , with many players bringing their own lamps for a night session .
so if you ever feel like hanging around the sinister areas down by the canals of treptow in the early hours of the morning , you may just chance upon my brother honing his dribble and pop .
ben knight 's little brother is a keen petanquist who lives within a dribble and pop of several boulodromes in the districts of kreuzberg , treptow and neukoelln .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

the warning comes days after four people were killed when north korean shells rained down on a south korean island . as if to prove that its threats are far from empty , north korea reportedly staged a firing drill on friday near the border with south korea . a south korean defense ministry spokesman said that explosions had been heard for about three hours in the early afternoon and they appeared to be from the north . there were no details about where the shells had landed but the exercise and north korea 's latest warnings sent a chill across south korea 's outposts . bildunterschrift : many inhabitants have now left yeonpyeong for the mainland their fear is not unfounded considering tuesday 's deadly attack on the tiny fishing and garrison island of yeonpyeong that killed four people , including two civilians , and wounded 18 more .
dozens of houses were reduced to rubble . the island , parts of which now resemble a warzone according to reports , has apparently emptied .
there are mainly troops and local officials left . islanders on other more distant outposts , such as baengnyeong near the spot where the south korean cheonan warship was sunk in march , fear they could be next . many residents have already tried to escape by taking crowded ferries to the mainland .
some were reportedly not able to buy tickets as the boats were fully booked . those who have to stay behind have stocked up on supplies such as water , instant food , blankets and candles . new defense minister in seoul a us aircraft carrier group is being sent to the yellow sea to join south korea 's navy for a four-day joint exercise that is set to start on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of houses were reduced to rubble but pyongyang warned on friday that north korea 's army would bring down " a shower of dreadful fire " if its enemies encroach upon its " dignity and sovereignty even in the least . " one of the first tasks of south korea ’ s new defense minister , kim kwan-jin , a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appointed on friday , will be to decide upon how to react to any future provocation . on thursday , south korean defense minister kim tae-young resigned after coming under fire for the army ’ s apparently slow response to tuesday ’ s attack . the south fired 80 shells at the north 's coastal artillery positions but it did not call in air strikes , apparently to avoid increasing the tension even more . " we suspect that the north sustained considerable damage , " a south korean military official said . the south has since decided to send in more troops and guns to five frontline islands and has said it will change the rules of engagement so that the military can hit back harder in case of future attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the son of kim oh-bock , right , was killed in the attack on tuesday hard-liners call for harsher response hard-line protesters in south korea 's capital have been calling on the government to react with more force to pyongyang in general . " we should not be scared of the enemy , " one demonstrator said .
" our people has to be unified so that we can fight back with full force .
conservative groups like us and the older generation that remembers the korean war have come here to show our solidarity . " however , other more left-wing south koreans say that president lee myung-bak ’ s hard-line attitude over the past two years is to blame for the current tension on the korean peninsula . act / afp / reuters / dpa editor : manasi gopalakrishnan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .
in 2002 , pool re removed exclusion clauses for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks .
the need for terrorism insurance has become more apparent since the sept .
11 attacks , which also damaged beyond repair the deutsche bank building adjacent to the world trade center .
deutsche bank later found itself in a legal dispute with the allianz and axa insurance companies , which disputed the status of the building as a total loss .
some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

dw-world.de pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 stealthy leverkusen reaps the rewards of hiding in plain sight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are making a low-key assault on the summit there have been so many surprises so far this season that the bundesliga is in no short supply of media darlings .
bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro what role do you think germany should play in stabilizing the eurozone ?
none !
dismantle the eu and the euro as quickly as possible before the entire eu ends up in one big , deep hole out of which there is no escape .
the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .
due to the expansion of the eu in jurisdiction and its administrative power , this has seemed to be sped through very quickly without much critical thinking to the point where it has may have overextended the whole project in its scope from what is practical . - philip , canada your article quoted herr heinemann , of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany , as saying , " does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ? "
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .
to employ an american idiom , europe is whistling past the graveyard on this issue . - michael , us ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections ireland is another country that proves that the euro can not succeed in practice . - davor , serbia cowen puts the burden on the back of families , students , workers , unemployed , health service , police and firefighters .
i wish there was an election to tell the politicians via bad language that they are traitors and gangsters to this country ...
the politicians are out of touch - they are living on the backs of the people . - michael , ireland germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax the irish republic must alter its budget so that all sectors contribute fairly .
it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .
many are little more than fly-by-nighters , who will simply move on when it looks like their activities will be put under the spotlight and seen as little more than shell companies who have contributed nothing to the nation . - roland , new zealand specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland is property in some european countries simply overvalued ?
this is mostly a result of easily attainable credit in the boom times .
another small country , iceland , also had credit access in the same manner and look at what happened to their economy and real estate market .
perhaps entire economies and individuals alike had better start embracing a more cash basis way of life ?
credit allows those to live above and beyond their means , a sort of false sense of having it all . - eugene via facebook the overvalued homes may not only be sinking in price due to the general economic state of ireland but also due to bad workmanship .
the place i rent is falling apart , cracks on walls and light bulbs hanging on a thread .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.11.2010 portugal and spain deny need for bailout amid fresh market jitters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe portugal will have to ask for an eu bailout lisbon and madrid as well as the eu commission have strongly rejected reports that the two countries need an international bailout .
it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .

"
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .

it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 26.11.2010 us unlikely to seize initiative in cancun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is sending an empty-handed delegation to cancun president obama failed to pass legislation this year that would curtail us greenhouse gas emissions .
in the wake of the democrats ' midterm election losses , it 's unlikely that the us will seize the initiative in cancun . a day after the democrats ' defeat in congressional elections this november , president barack obama acknowledged that it would be hard to push a climate treaty through congress .
most of the newly elected republican senators and representatives either deny climate change or they contest its dangers .
even a few democrats are sceptical about it .
they 're afraid of the negative ramifications a treaty might have on the economy due to higher energy prices and rising unemployment .
looking for new means bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environmental protection agency may be obama 's last best hope obama , who made climate policy a top issue of his presidential campaign , has indicated that progress remains possible , despite the disastrous outcome of this year 's midterm elections for his party .
" carbon trade was just one way of skinning the cat .
it was not the only way .
and i 'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem . "
he 'll need to , if he wants to keep the promise he made during at last year 's summit in copenhagen : to reduce the united states ' carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade .
at least one option is open to the president .
the us environmental authority epa classified carbon dioxide as a public threat to health , and has introduced regulations for the emissions of cars and factories .
the first guidelines will take effect next year .
republicans will try to stop the guidelines from being implemented , but even if they pass an opposing bill in congress , the president would need to sign it into law .
that 's not going to happen , says todd stern , us special envoy for climate change : " the president has made clear , and we have made clear , that the united states is standing behind the pledge that we made last year .
there 's no change in that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senator john kerry failed to get republicans to support an energy bill this year compromise with republicans ?
president obama hopes to compromise with republicans on a series of smaller climate policy issues .
nick loris , energy expert for the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank , says this may yet be possible .
" there are policies that we would n't support but i think they can get done .
i mean even if you look at president bush 's administration – there were two energy bills in 2005 and 2007 that conservatives and proponents of the free market opposed but republicans got behind , " loris said . like many conservatives in the us , loris is not fond of such bills .
he says energy generation should be left to a free market .
however , a number of republicans support tax breaks for wind , solar , and nuclear energy , as well as higher energy efficiency standards .
despite this , the comprehensive energy bill that passed the house of representatives was never even debated in the senate .
this has left individual states in the us to take the lead .
some states , for example california , have already passed strict waste gas regulations .
california , the world 's eighth largest economy , has also proposed a law for trading emissions fashioned upon the european model .
it aims to provide a market-based solution for encouraging companies to embrace cleaner technologies and higher energy efficiency standards .
obama 's climate envoy , todd stern , recently acknowledged that california has always played a pioneering role in environmental policy .
he also said that he was very relieved to hear that the effort to derail california 's carbon trade bill was defeated in a referendum during the midterm elections .
hoping for the president 's leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick loris says obama may be able to compromise with republicans on some issues so other than the efforts of individual states , the us delegation will arrive at cancun with empty hands .
according to greenpeace climate expert kyle ash , the us government 's strategy prior to the midterm elections was to prolong international negotiations until a us climate treaty was passed .
if obama holds on to this strategy , this could mean another three years of climate stalemate – until the next presidential elections .
yet kyle ash also sees another possibility .
" obama has the legal authority to commit the us to strong targets and to come to agreement on all of the issues in cancun , " he said .
obama could even make financial commitments , since long-term investments do n't have to be passed in their entirety by the current congress .
but ash also says one would have to be particularly optimistic about these prospects given the current political and economic climate .
despite this , the greenpeace expert hopes that obama will seize the initiative after his recent loss in the midterm elections .
" if there 's one issue that 's super important , that affects not just foreign policy but domestic policy in a big way - that 's climate change . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .
prediction : 2-1 wolfsburg last week 's results : 4 points schalke - bremen 4-0 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- frankfurt - hoffenheim 0-4 -lrb- dw prediction 0-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach - mainz 2-3 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- freiburg - dortmund 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-3 -rrb- hanover - hamburg 3-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- nuremberg - kaiserslautern 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 1-0 -rrb- leverkusen - bayern 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-2 -rrb- stuttgart - cologne 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-0 -rrb- st. pauli - wolfsburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- total for the season : 58 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

new delhi accused islamabad of failing in its promise to punish the alleged masterminds . when gunmen targeted india 's financial hub and symbol of the country ’ s economic rise on november 26 2008 , the media were quick to describe the carefully-orchestrated attacks as india ’ s " 9/11 . "
they soon became known as india ’ s " 26/11 . "
two years later , the wounds have not healed , says security expert afsar karim in new delhi : " this is because those behind the attacks have not yet been brought to justice .
the threat , which emanates from pakistan , has not lessened because pakistan has not acted against the terror groups which operated from its territory .
a wound can only heal if there is no danger that something like this will be repeated . " bildunterschrift : gunmen assailed mumbai 's victoria central station and several other buildings on " 26/11 " the attacks did little to improve the already tense relations between india and pakistan .
the only surviving gunman ajmal amir kasab , who is pakistani , has said that the officially banned pakistan-based terror group , lashkar-e-taiba , was behind the bloodbath . new delhi has accused islamabad of being slow to look into the cause of the attacks and of conducting its investigation half-heartedly .
lashkar-e-taiba and its head hafiz saeed are thought to have close connections to pakistan 's secret services . delhi claims the highest circles in pakistan must have been aware of the plans to attack mumbai . better relations needed between india and pakistan " i am one of those who think it is important for the whole region that india and pakistan have good relations , " says amitabh mattoo , a political expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university . " for india as an aspiring nation it is very important to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors .
four years ago , there were some good talks with pakistan under former president musharraf and many thought this might lead to a breakthrough . " but after the mumbai attacks , india wanted pakistan to act against lashkar-e-taiba and yet the founders are still running free , holding speeches all over the country .
if the pakistani government doesn ’ t change its attitude , the instability will go on . " slow implementation of reforms after the attacks , the indian government announced it would invest more in security and prevention .
police reforms were introduced and the media , which were accused of playing into the hands of the terrorists with their reporting , agreed to act according to a code of honor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian home minister p. chidambaram paid tribute to the victims on the second anniversary they said that they would censor themselves at times of crisis and not talk about security plans for instance . " there have been reforms but these have perhaps not been implemented as fast as we would have liked , " explained afsar karim . " the reforms could help to gather more information about terrorist activities inside india .
but activities outside of india can not be prevented .
if the problem of terrorism is not tackled at its root there could be hundreds of new targets and we wo n't be able to do anything against the threat . " in response to india 's repeated criticism , pakistan 's foreign minister said on friday that it was the government 's " desire to punish those involved " in the mumbai attacks . author : priya esselborn editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .

st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .

they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .

in the wake of the democrats ' midterm election losses , it 's unlikely that the us will seize the initiative in cancun . a day after the democrats ' defeat in congressional elections this november , president barack obama acknowledged that it would be hard to push a climate treaty through congress .
most of the newly elected republican senators and representatives either deny climate change or they contest its dangers .
even a few democrats are sceptical about it .
they 're afraid of the negative ramifications a treaty might have on the economy due to higher energy prices and rising unemployment .
looking for new means bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environmental protection agency may be obama 's last best hope obama , who made climate policy a top issue of his presidential campaign , has indicated that progress remains possible , despite the disastrous outcome of this year 's midterm elections for his party .
" carbon trade was just one way of skinning the cat .
it was not the only way .
and i 'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem . "
he 'll need to , if he wants to keep the promise he made during at last year 's summit in copenhagen : to reduce the united states ' carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade .
at least one option is open to the president .
the us environmental authority epa classified carbon dioxide as a public threat to health , and has introduced regulations for the emissions of cars and factories .
the first guidelines will take effect next year .
republicans will try to stop the guidelines from being implemented , but even if they pass an opposing bill in congress , the president would need to sign it into law .
that 's not going to happen , says todd stern , us special envoy for climate change : " the president has made clear , and we have made clear , that the united states is standing behind the pledge that we made last year .
there 's no change in that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senator john kerry failed to get republicans to support an energy bill this year compromise with republicans ?
president obama hopes to compromise with republicans on a series of smaller climate policy issues .
nick loris , energy expert for the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank , says this may yet be possible .
" there are policies that we would n't support but i think they can get done .
i mean even if you look at president bush 's administration – there were two energy bills in 2005 and 2007 that conservatives and proponents of the free market opposed but republicans got behind , " loris said . like many conservatives in the us , loris is not fond of such bills .
he says energy generation should be left to a free market .
however , a number of republicans support tax breaks for wind , solar , and nuclear energy , as well as higher energy efficiency standards .
despite this , the comprehensive energy bill that passed the house of representatives was never even debated in the senate .
this has left individual states in the us to take the lead .
some states , for example california , have already passed strict waste gas regulations .
california , the world 's eighth largest economy , has also proposed a law for trading emissions fashioned upon the european model .
it aims to provide a market-based solution for encouraging companies to embrace cleaner technologies and higher energy efficiency standards .
obama 's climate envoy , todd stern , recently acknowledged that california has always played a pioneering role in environmental policy .
he also said that he was very relieved to hear that the effort to derail california 's carbon trade bill was defeated in a referendum during the midterm elections .
hoping for the president 's leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick loris says obama may be able to compromise with republicans on some issues so other than the efforts of individual states , the us delegation will arrive at cancun with empty hands .
according to greenpeace climate expert kyle ash , the us government 's strategy prior to the midterm elections was to prolong international negotiations until a us climate treaty was passed .
if obama holds on to this strategy , this could mean another three years of climate stalemate – until the next presidential elections .
yet kyle ash also sees another possibility .
" obama has the legal authority to commit the us to strong targets and to come to agreement on all of the issues in cancun , " he said .
obama could even make financial commitments , since long-term investments do n't have to be passed in their entirety by the current congress .
but ash also says one would have to be particularly optimistic about these prospects given the current political and economic climate .
despite this , the greenpeace expert hopes that obama will seize the initiative after his recent loss in the midterm elections .
" if there 's one issue that 's super important , that affects not just foreign policy but domestic policy in a big way - that 's climate change . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

in fact , many have already left , looking for better prospects overseas . at a ' show your business week ' fair in the center of dublin , irish entrepreneurs have been showcasing their products and services , hoping to give their businesses a boost .
right in the middle of town , the exhibition gave these firms a prime spot to advertise .
but that wo n't be enough to change their fortunes as trading conditions in ireland have become incredibly difficult .
jimmy o 'reilly is one of them .
he has had to cut his workforce of laborers from eight to two at the small building firm he runs .
he has considered moving his business abroad .
but for now , he 's staying .
" unfortunately we have two kids here , and i 'm a bit loyal to ireland , " he said .
" i think we 'll stick with it and make an effort to keep it afloat . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the food industry , you move where the work is it 's easy for people to move their businesses within the european union , says neil barrett , who owns a food start-up .
" it 's a common market , so it 's as close to london as it is to cork , so you 'll move wherever it works .
because you have to . "
things are so bad , barrett says that it 's understandable that entrepreneurs would consider emigrating .
" this is a food business , and the food business is probably the toughest business around anyway , and this is probably the roughest year that any of us has ever lived through , and next year 's probably going to be worse . "
all talk ?
just how many people will up and leave ireland for better prospects elsewhere is impossible to say , but james wickham , a migration expert at trinity college dublin , says almost everyone is talking about it .
" it 's an absolutely standard thing for us in education to say , ' well all my students are talking about leaving . '
how many people have actually left is not clear , although it 's unambiguous that the number is rising .
there is a sort of general atmosphere of ' oh my god , i 'm getting out . '
" those statistics that are available suggest the numbers are already high .
according to the economic and social research institute , irish emigration jumped by 40 percent to 65,000 in the year to april 2010 .
it predicts 200,000 people will emigrate by 2015 .
student exodus the economic downturn in ireland is particularly worrying for students who wonder whether they will find jobs once they 've finished their studies .
ireland 's union of students predicts 150,000 young people will choose to leave the country to find work in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are expected to leave ireland in droves professor wickham says emigrating is not seen as a big deal by young irish people .
" this has happened before .
in the 1980s i can remember saying to my students ' last one out , turn out the light . '
" he pointed out that ireland , like poland , has for a long time been a country where " young people do n't think twice - or they think twice but not three times - before they emigrate . "
" we are a society where it is normal to leave .
if you talk to young germans in the middle of a recession - they do n't leave , " he said .
but wickham put a positive spin on the possibility of thousands of skilled workers leaving the country .
" one of the things we 've learnt from the last mass emigration is that people come back , and people travel backwards and forwards , " he said .
" the gains from emigration - from people coming back , from people setting up new concepts from business contacts , intellectual contacts , cultural contacts , professional contacts - you know those are real benefits . "

but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.11.2010 ireland 's young professionals look to flee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 200,000 people are expected to emigrate by 2015 as ireland 's austerity measures bite , many of the country 's young businesspeople are considering leaving the country .
in fact , many have already left , looking for better prospects overseas . at a ' show your business week ' fair in the center of dublin , irish entrepreneurs have been showcasing their products and services , hoping to give their businesses a boost .
right in the middle of town , the exhibition gave these firms a prime spot to advertise .
but that wo n't be enough to change their fortunes as trading conditions in ireland have become incredibly difficult .
jimmy o 'reilly is one of them .
he has had to cut his workforce of laborers from eight to two at the small building firm he runs .
he has considered moving his business abroad .
but for now , he 's staying .
" unfortunately we have two kids here , and i 'm a bit loyal to ireland , " he said .
" i think we 'll stick with it and make an effort to keep it afloat . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the food industry , you move where the work is it 's easy for people to move their businesses within the european union , says neil barrett , who owns a food start-up .
" it 's a common market , so it 's as close to london as it is to cork , so you 'll move wherever it works .
because you have to . "
things are so bad , barrett says that it 's understandable that entrepreneurs would consider emigrating .
" this is a food business , and the food business is probably the toughest business around anyway , and this is probably the roughest year that any of us has ever lived through , and next year 's probably going to be worse . "
all talk ?
just how many people will up and leave ireland for better prospects elsewhere is impossible to say , but james wickham , a migration expert at trinity college dublin , says almost everyone is talking about it .
" it 's an absolutely standard thing for us in education to say , ' well all my students are talking about leaving . '
how many people have actually left is not clear , although it 's unambiguous that the number is rising .
there is a sort of general atmosphere of ' oh my god , i 'm getting out . '
" those statistics that are available suggest the numbers are already high .
according to the economic and social research institute , irish emigration jumped by 40 percent to 65,000 in the year to april 2010 .
it predicts 200,000 people will emigrate by 2015 .
student exodus the economic downturn in ireland is particularly worrying for students who wonder whether they will find jobs once they 've finished their studies .
ireland 's union of students predicts 150,000 young people will choose to leave the country to find work in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are expected to leave ireland in droves professor wickham says emigrating is not seen as a big deal by young irish people .
" this has happened before .
in the 1980s i can remember saying to my students ' last one out , turn out the light . '
" he pointed out that ireland , like poland , has for a long time been a country where " young people do n't think twice - or they think twice but not three times - before they emigrate . "
" we are a society where it is normal to leave .
if you talk to young germans in the middle of a recession - they do n't leave , " he said .
but wickham put a positive spin on the possibility of thousands of skilled workers leaving the country .
" one of the things we 've learnt from the last mass emigration is that people come back , and people travel backwards and forwards , " he said .
" the gains from emigration - from people coming back , from people setting up new concepts from business contacts , intellectual contacts , cultural contacts , professional contacts - you know those are real benefits . "

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

men have twice the rate of leukemia and women have three times the rate of thyroid cancer . newly published figures from the lower saxony state cancer registry show that in the area around asse , the site of a controversial nuclear waste dump near wolffenbuettel , some cancer rates are higher than normal . between 2002 and 2009 there were 12 cases of leukemia in the greater asse region .
the area had twice the rate expected for men .
while there was no significant increase in leukemia for women , their rate of thyroid cancer was three times as high as normal . the government has not yet determined if the increase is related to the proximity to the nuclear waste site .
a working group of representatives from lower saxony ’ s environment , social , and health ministries as well as the federal agency for radiation protection is set to meet over the next few weeks to take a closer look at the data . joerg roehmann , the district administrator in wolfenbuettel , said in an interview with german public television that the numbers needed to be analyzed and put into context before any conclusions can be made . " i 'd like to appeal to anyone from this area who has been diagnosed with leukemia , for example , to come forward , along with doctors or anyone treating these patients to help us make comparisons and create a context for this data , " he said . " we do n't know anything about exact location , age , occupation , or family history in these cases . " no blame yet asse was originally a salt mine .
between 1967 and 1978 around 126,000 drums of waste were stored in the facility .
more recently it 's been declared unstable because of a danger of collapse and water leaks and is due to be emptied out and shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is stored in a former salt mine ursula kleber is on the board of directors of a non-profit organization called aufpassen , a play on words with asse and the german word ' aufpassen , ' meaning ' to take care of . ' aufpassen addresses problems and concerns relating to the site . " because of asse , we 're pretty nervous around here , " kleber told deutsche welle " so it 's good that this investigation is taking place .
but we do n't have enough information yet to say this was caused by asse . " statistical variance while the exact cause of the higher leukemia and thyroid cancer rates are being examined , it is important to note that the actual number of cases reported is relatively small . in the seven years covered in the newly released statistics , 12 cases of leukemia in men were reported from the greater asse area .
the average is five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radiation levels are carefully monitored at asse dr. stefanie seltmann from the german cancer research center in heidelberg told deutsche welle that these numbers are not necessarily cause for alarm . " if you assume that there are about 10,000 small communities like this in germany , " she said , " then strictly from a standpoint of statistical variation , if five cases is average , some communities will have 12 while others wo n't have any , without any particular reason such as radiation . " it is slightly more concerning that in every year surveyed this statistical variation existed , but dr. seltmann says it could all turn out to be just a coincidence . with such a small sample group , definitive answers will have to wait a few more weeks for the conclusion of the working group in lower saxony . author : matt zuvela , holly fox -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while there was no significant increase in leukemia for women , their rate of thyroid cancer was three times as high as normal . the government has not yet determined if the increase is related to the proximity to the nuclear waste site .
a working group of representatives from lower saxony ’ s environment , social , and health ministries as well as the federal agency for radiation protection is set to meet over the next few weeks to take a closer look at the data . joerg roehmann , the district administrator in wolfenbuettel , said in an interview with german public television that the numbers needed to be analyzed and put into context before any conclusions can be made . " i 'd like to appeal to anyone from this area who has been diagnosed with leukemia , for example , to come forward , along with doctors or anyone treating these patients to help us make comparisons and create a context for this data , " he said . " we do n't know anything about exact location , age , occupation , or family history in these cases . " no blame yet asse was originally a salt mine .
between 1967 and 1978 around 126,000 drums of waste were stored in the facility .
more recently it 's been declared unstable because of a danger of collapse and water leaks and is due to be emptied out and shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is stored in a former salt mine ursula kleber is on the board of directors of a non-profit organization called aufpassen , a play on words with asse and the german word ' aufpassen , ' meaning ' to take care of . ' aufpassen addresses problems and concerns relating to the site . " because of asse , we 're pretty nervous around here , " kleber told deutsche welle " so it 's good that this investigation is taking place .
but we do n't have enough information yet to say this was caused by asse . " statistical variance while the exact cause of the higher leukemia and thyroid cancer rates are being examined , it is important to note that the actual number of cases reported is relatively small . in the seven years covered in the newly released statistics , 12 cases of leukemia in men were reported from the greater asse area .
the average is five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radiation levels are carefully monitored at asse dr. stefanie seltmann from the german cancer research center in heidelberg told deutsche welle that these numbers are not necessarily cause for alarm . " if you assume that there are about 10,000 small communities like this in germany , " she said , " then strictly from a standpoint of statistical variation , if five cases is average , some communities will have 12 while others wo n't have any , without any particular reason such as radiation . " it is slightly more concerning that in every year surveyed this statistical variation existed , but dr. seltmann says it could all turn out to be just a coincidence . with such a small sample group , definitive answers will have to wait a few more weeks for the conclusion of the working group in lower saxony . author : matt zuvela , holly fox -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

the jury is still out as to how dangerous bpa really is . beginning in 2011 , both the manufacture and sale of baby bottles containing the chemical bisphenol-a -lrb- bpa -rrb- will be banned across the european union , the european commission said on thursday .
" the decision … is good news for european parents who can be sure that as of mid-2011 plastic infant feeding bottles will not include bpa , " said john dalli , the commissioner in charge of health and consumer policy , in a statement .
from march 1 , 2011 , the manufacture of such bottles will be illegal within the eu , and from june 1 , 2011 , it will no longer be legal for bpa bottles produced abroad to be imported to the eu or sold on the european market .
how dangerous is bpa ?
bpa is widely used in plastic containers and packaging around the world .
although studies have linked bpa exposure to cancer , obesity and the early onset of puberty , its risks are still disputed .
the european food safety agency recently issued a report on the chemical , saying that it was safe in small quantities and yet admitting areas of uncertainty .
" it can not be excluded that there might be an effect on the development , immune response or tumor promotion , " dalli said in an october 7 statement .
france and denmark are the only two eu countries to already have a ban on bpa bottles in place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.11.2010 portugal and spain deny need for bailout amid fresh market jitters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many believe portugal will have to ask for an eu bailout lisbon and madrid as well as the eu commission have strongly rejected reports that the two countries need an international bailout .
it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro what role do you think germany should play in stabilizing the eurozone ?
none !
dismantle the eu and the euro as quickly as possible before the entire eu ends up in one big , deep hole out of which there is no escape .
the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .
due to the expansion of the eu in jurisdiction and its administrative power , this has seemed to be sped through very quickly without much critical thinking to the point where it has may have overextended the whole project in its scope from what is practical . - philip , canada your article quoted herr heinemann , of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany , as saying , " does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ? "
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .
to employ an american idiom , europe is whistling past the graveyard on this issue . - michael , us ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections ireland is another country that proves that the euro can not succeed in practice . - davor , serbia cowen puts the burden on the back of families , students , workers , unemployed , health service , police and firefighters .
i wish there was an election to tell the politicians via bad language that they are traitors and gangsters to this country ...
the politicians are out of touch - they are living on the backs of the people . - michael , ireland germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax the irish republic must alter its budget so that all sectors contribute fairly .
it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .
many are little more than fly-by-nighters , who will simply move on when it looks like their activities will be put under the spotlight and seen as little more than shell companies who have contributed nothing to the nation . - roland , new zealand specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland is property in some european countries simply overvalued ?
this is mostly a result of easily attainable credit in the boom times .
another small country , iceland , also had credit access in the same manner and look at what happened to their economy and real estate market .
perhaps entire economies and individuals alike had better start embracing a more cash basis way of life ?
credit allows those to live above and beyond their means , a sort of false sense of having it all . - eugene via facebook the overvalued homes may not only be sinking in price due to the general economic state of ireland but also due to bad workmanship .
the place i rent is falling apart , cracks on walls and light bulbs hanging on a thread .
built in the boom and going out like a bang . - joel via facebook compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro germany has seen a number of its own currencies come and go : the deutschmark , the reichsmark and , before that , the mark .
now some analysts are grumbling that the euro may be on its way out too .
-lrb- 24.11.2010 -rrb- ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections irish prime minister brian cowen has announced early elections , as he faces discord from allies and enemies over his handling of the economy .
on sunday , ireland requested financial aid from the eu and imf .
-lrb- 23.11.2010 -rrb- germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

ireland bailout reignites fears about the future of the euro what role do you think germany should play in stabilizing the eurozone ?
none !
dismantle the eu and the euro as quickly as possible before the entire eu ends up in one big , deep hole out of which there is no escape .
the eu the euro are a big mistake . - vera , germany the concern for german taxpayers is that , by helping to sink more money into eurozone countries with high government debt , that will only add to their debt burden that they will not pay off in the end , and could result in germany paying for the losses of other countries .
due to the expansion of the eu in jurisdiction and its administrative power , this has seemed to be sped through very quickly without much critical thinking to the point where it has may have overextended the whole project in its scope from what is practical . - philip , canada your article quoted herr heinemann , of the centre for european economic research in mannheim , germany , as saying , " does anybody see the us currency union breaking apart because of the imminent californian bankruptcy ? "
is herr heineman really so ignorant ?
it is illogical and invalid to compare europe and its currency with american states and the us currency .
europe has a monetary union , but not a fiscal or political union .
the us has a monetary , fiscal , and political union , in which the fifty us states are more analogous to the german laender than they are to the sovereign states of europe .
so , a better comparison with californian bankruptcy 's impact on us monetary union would be to think that baden-wuerttemberg would establish its own currency in response to declaration of bankruptcy in bayern .
to employ an american idiom , europe is whistling past the graveyard on this issue . - michael , us ireland 's financial rescue triggers early elections ireland is another country that proves that the euro can not succeed in practice . - davor , serbia cowen puts the burden on the back of families , students , workers , unemployed , health service , police and firefighters .
i wish there was an election to tell the politicians via bad language that they are traitors and gangsters to this country ...
the politicians are out of touch - they are living on the backs of the people . - michael , ireland germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax the irish republic must alter its budget so that all sectors contribute fairly .
it has been too eager to attract firms who have not invested anything substantial .
many are little more than fly-by-nighters , who will simply move on when it looks like their activities will be put under the spotlight and seen as little more than shell companies who have contributed nothing to the nation . - roland , new zealand specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland is property in some european countries simply overvalued ?
this is mostly a result of easily attainable credit in the boom times .
another small country , iceland , also had credit access in the same manner and look at what happened to their economy and real estate market .
perhaps entire economies and individuals alike had better start embracing a more cash basis way of life ?
credit allows those to live above and beyond their means , a sort of false sense of having it all . - eugene via facebook the overvalued homes may not only be sinking in price due to the general economic state of ireland but also due to bad workmanship .
the place i rent is falling apart , cracks on walls and light bulbs hanging on a thread .
built in the boom and going out like a bang . - joel via facebook compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .

higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .
prediction : 2-1 wolfsburg last week 's results : 4 points schalke - bremen 4-0 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- frankfurt - hoffenheim 0-4 -lrb- dw prediction 0-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach - mainz 2-3 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- freiburg - dortmund 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-3 -rrb- hanover - hamburg 3-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- nuremberg - kaiserslautern 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 1-0 -rrb- leverkusen - bayern 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-2 -rrb- stuttgart - cologne 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-0 -rrb- st. pauli - wolfsburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- total for the season : 58 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german chancellor angela merkel chimed in with a similar view .
" it is also desirable for us because of the g-20 , with russia being a member of the g-20 , " she told reporters in the capital on friday evening .
" we would like to finally complete the doha round of trade talks , and we would very much like to do this with russia as a wto member , " she added .
russia started its campaign to join the wto in 1993 and is the last major economic power not to be a member .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia still protects its industries with import tariffs gently rebuffed but merkel was less enthusiastic about russia 's proposal for a free trade area from lisbon to vladivostok , which putin had suggested in a guest editorial in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of his visit .
germany generally welcomes the idea of closer economic ties , but merkel said a free trade area between russia and the european union was " more of a question for the future . "
" we are neighbors and , just like in other areas , we will intensify our partnership step by step , " she said and stressed that if there was to be a free trade zone , all of the countries would have to be members of the wto .
but merkel made it clear that she does not see russia ever joining the eurozone , whereas putin said he was " open " to such cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom stands to lose out under the eu 's gas market liberalization plans german sympathy merkel voiced sympathy for russia 's criticism of eu plans that would see infrastructure and distribution separated in the gas sector .
speaking to business leaders in germany earlier in the day , putin said the proposals amounted to " uncivilized robbery . "
under the plans , companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom would have to sell its stake in overland pipelines in eu territory to allow smaller players access to the gas markets .
" during the negotiations -lsb- in the eu -rsb- germany has never been a fan of that philosophy , " she said and promised to argue russia 's case in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 26.11.2010 tuna fishing debate rages at paris conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large bluefin tuna can fetch up to 70,000 euros fishermen and environmentalists have been sparring at a paris conference over the future of the bluefin tuna .
the highly prized fish , which is served in sushi , can fetch up to 70,000 euros a piece at wholesale markets . representatives from the 48-member countries of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- are considering whether to tighten fishing quotas for atlantic bluefin tuna at a meeting in paris that is due to wrap up on saturday .
though the talks include many endangered species – from sharks to swordfish – tuna is the most contentious .
environmentalists say decades of overfishing have depleted stocks of bluefin tuna to an extent that threatens the species ' existence .
they also fear that current guidelines for fishing the tuna are being flaunted , and that iccat is doing too little to stop this .
" bluefin tuna are some of the most amazing fish in the sea and i think they 're so undervalued , " gemma parks , who is representing the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- at the talks , told deutsche welle .
" they can accelerate faster than a porsche , they grow up to 300 - 400 kilos , they can live for up to 40 years , they 're a warm blooded fish , which is highly unusual , and they 're highly migratory . "
parks said that the wwf is seeking an end to industrial fishing , especially the use of the purse-seine netting .
the purse-seine is a floating drawstring net that loops around an enormous area .
it can capture thousands of fish at once , which are then hauled to coastal fish farms where they are fattened for market .
" large-scale , industrial fishery , which is the purse-seine fleets , is really the sector specifically which is the culprit of the illegal fishing and the rule breaking , " parks said .
ignoring the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups say the purse-seine nets are doing irreparable damage environmentalists say rule breaking is rampant in the mediterranean sea – the only place with significant remaining tuna stocks , since the atlantic 's supply of bluefin tuna has mostly been depleted .
though the quota for blue fin tuna in the mediterranean is set at 13,500 tons , parks says fleets from major fishing countries like france , italy and spain regularly engage in a black market trade .
a recent report by the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- unveiled a culture of over-exploitation and cheating that is largely overlooked by government officials .
almudena gomez , who is representing the spanish fishing industry at the conference , says those caught cheating will be punished , but she believes cutting the quota any further , as environmentalists propose , would be a disaster for fishermen .
" we do n't have to give false alarms with false figures , " she told deutsche welle .
" the stock is recovering .
the recovery plan is working quite well . "
meanwhile , an independent report commissioned by greenpeace to coincide with the conference found that 30 percent of tinned tunas tested in a dozen countries were mislabelled or had other irregularities that showed up in a genetic analysis .
some of the 50 brands sampled contained different species of tuna across the same product , or two different species in the same tin , an illegal practice in europe .
some tins , for example , labelled as skipjack - a plentiful tuna-like fish found in the indian and pacific oceans - also had bigeye or yellowtail tuna , both species with declining populations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european tuna is exported to japan protecting fish or livelihoods yet in the mediterranean port of marseille , tuna fishing is not only central to the economy , it 's a way of life .
some 80 percent of the mediterranean catch is exported to japan , the world 's major market for tuna , which is savoured there in sushi .
murad khaloul , head of the french fishing union , accuses iccat and european union bureaucrats of needlessly tightening quotas .
" they 've broken up almost half of our fleet in the last decade , " khaloul told deutsche welle .
" they 've destroyed fishing in the north sea .
there 's nothing left there , so they 're setting their sights on the mediterranean .
and tuna seems to be in style .
this is simply genocide of fishermen . "
but others believe that icatt is not doing enough to save tuna stocks .
some businesses are even taking steps on their own .
giant retailers like carrefour , ikea and several sushi chains have signed a tuna market manifesto – pledging not to sell or buy bluefin tuna until a proper recovery plan is put into place .
the wwf also reported on friday that french supermarket chain auchan , french food services giant sodexo and british restaurant chains pret a manger and moshi moshi have also pledged to stop serving atlantic bluefin tuna until the situation improves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 stealthy leverkusen reaps the rewards of hiding in plain sight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen are making a low-key assault on the summit there have been so many surprises so far this season that the bundesliga is in no short supply of media darlings .
bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

the warning comes days after four people were killed when north korean shells rained down on a south korean island . as if to prove that its threats are far from empty , north korea reportedly staged a firing drill on friday near the border with south korea . a south korean defense ministry spokesman said that explosions had been heard for about three hours in the early afternoon and they appeared to be from the north . there were no details about where the shells had landed but the exercise and north korea 's latest warnings sent a chill across south korea 's outposts . bildunterschrift : many inhabitants have now left yeonpyeong for the mainland their fear is not unfounded considering tuesday 's deadly attack on the tiny fishing and garrison island of yeonpyeong that killed four people , including two civilians , and wounded 18 more .
dozens of houses were reduced to rubble . the island , parts of which now resemble a warzone according to reports , has apparently emptied .
there are mainly troops and local officials left . islanders on other more distant outposts , such as baengnyeong near the spot where the south korean cheonan warship was sunk in march , fear they could be next . many residents have already tried to escape by taking crowded ferries to the mainland .
some were reportedly not able to buy tickets as the boats were fully booked . those who have to stay behind have stocked up on supplies such as water , instant food , blankets and candles . new defense minister in seoul a us aircraft carrier group is being sent to the yellow sea to join south korea 's navy for a four-day joint exercise that is set to start on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of houses were reduced to rubble but pyongyang warned on friday that north korea 's army would bring down " a shower of dreadful fire " if its enemies encroach upon its " dignity and sovereignty even in the least . " one of the first tasks of south korea ’ s new defense minister , kim kwan-jin , a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appointed on friday , will be to decide upon how to react to any future provocation . on thursday , south korean defense minister kim tae-young resigned after coming under fire for the army ’ s apparently slow response to tuesday ’ s attack . the south fired 80 shells at the north 's coastal artillery positions but it did not call in air strikes , apparently to avoid increasing the tension even more . " we suspect that the north sustained considerable damage , " a south korean military official said . the south has since decided to send in more troops and guns to five frontline islands and has said it will change the rules of engagement so that the military can hit back harder in case of future attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the son of kim oh-bock , right , was killed in the attack on tuesday hard-liners call for harsher response hard-line protesters in south korea 's capital have been calling on the government to react with more force to pyongyang in general . " we should not be scared of the enemy , " one demonstrator said .
" our people has to be unified so that we can fight back with full force .
conservative groups like us and the older generation that remembers the korean war have come here to show our solidarity . " however , other more left-wing south koreans say that president lee myung-bak ’ s hard-line attitude over the past two years is to blame for the current tension on the korean peninsula . act / afp / reuters / dpa editor : manasi gopalakrishnan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 26.11.2010 too cool for boules - berlin 's petanquists spin the metal balls their way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boules is cool again , or so they say , with registered clubs mushrooming all over france and the uk .
but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the wrist but it was n't the sight of his favorite social game being hijacked by a bunch of giddy , overpaid fools that so offended my brother - a man who does get frustrated with that sort of thing - it was that the journalist made a distinction between this and " the little image in his head " of normal , traditional boules , also known as petanque : a game for morose , alcoholic french pensioners in string vests and flat caps .
the truth about boules certainly , drink does flow at the boulodromes my brother regularly attends on the banks of berlin 's canals , and perhaps the over-60 's bracket is slightly better represented than in other sports .
but berlin 's boules scene is a happy mix of genders , ages and nationalities .

but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks . " please , can you get as little information as possible from that guardian article , " my brother says to me , looking strained with exasperation when he learns i 'm planning to write about his favorite pastime .
he is referring to a piece published over the summer about the new trend for boules in france .
the author took the occasion of a celebrity boules tournament set up by fashion icon karl lagerfeld in st. tropez , and then described at length how the stereotypical gallic pastime was suddenly in again .
the article was illustrated with photos of supermodels and film-stars idling around , gaily flinging metal balls all over the place while wearing straw hats , white shoes and similarly breezy fin-de-siecle attire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the wrist but it was n't the sight of his favorite social game being hijacked by a bunch of giddy , overpaid fools that so offended my brother - a man who does get frustrated with that sort of thing - it was that the journalist made a distinction between this and " the little image in his head " of normal , traditional boules , also known as petanque : a game for morose , alcoholic french pensioners in string vests and flat caps .
the truth about boules certainly , drink does flow at the boulodromes my brother regularly attends on the banks of berlin 's canals , and perhaps the over-60 's bracket is slightly better represented than in other sports .
but berlin 's boules scene is a happy mix of genders , ages and nationalities .
in fact , it is one of the few public spaces where ' old ' berlin - the city 's dwindling number of locally born residents - mingles freely with ' new ' berlin - the growing hordes of international , pleasure-seeking youth .
a life of leisure can be a great social glue .

in the wake of the democrats ' midterm election losses , it 's unlikely that the us will seize the initiative in cancun . a day after the democrats ' defeat in congressional elections this november , president barack obama acknowledged that it would be hard to push a climate treaty through congress .
most of the newly elected republican senators and representatives either deny climate change or they contest its dangers .
even a few democrats are sceptical about it .
they 're afraid of the negative ramifications a treaty might have on the economy due to higher energy prices and rising unemployment .
looking for new means bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environmental protection agency may be obama 's last best hope obama , who made climate policy a top issue of his presidential campaign , has indicated that progress remains possible , despite the disastrous outcome of this year 's midterm elections for his party .
" carbon trade was just one way of skinning the cat .
it was not the only way .
and i 'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem . "
he 'll need to , if he wants to keep the promise he made during at last year 's summit in copenhagen : to reduce the united states ' carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade .
at least one option is open to the president .
the us environmental authority epa classified carbon dioxide as a public threat to health , and has introduced regulations for the emissions of cars and factories .
the first guidelines will take effect next year .
republicans will try to stop the guidelines from being implemented , but even if they pass an opposing bill in congress , the president would need to sign it into law .
that 's not going to happen , says todd stern , us special envoy for climate change : " the president has made clear , and we have made clear , that the united states is standing behind the pledge that we made last year .
there 's no change in that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senator john kerry failed to get republicans to support an energy bill this year compromise with republicans ?
president obama hopes to compromise with republicans on a series of smaller climate policy issues .
nick loris , energy expert for the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank , says this may yet be possible .
" there are policies that we would n't support but i think they can get done .
i mean even if you look at president bush 's administration – there were two energy bills in 2005 and 2007 that conservatives and proponents of the free market opposed but republicans got behind , " loris said . like many conservatives in the us , loris is not fond of such bills .
he says energy generation should be left to a free market .
however , a number of republicans support tax breaks for wind , solar , and nuclear energy , as well as higher energy efficiency standards .
despite this , the comprehensive energy bill that passed the house of representatives was never even debated in the senate .
this has left individual states in the us to take the lead .
some states , for example california , have already passed strict waste gas regulations .
california , the world 's eighth largest economy , has also proposed a law for trading emissions fashioned upon the european model .
it aims to provide a market-based solution for encouraging companies to embrace cleaner technologies and higher energy efficiency standards .
obama 's climate envoy , todd stern , recently acknowledged that california has always played a pioneering role in environmental policy .
he also said that he was very relieved to hear that the effort to derail california 's carbon trade bill was defeated in a referendum during the midterm elections .
hoping for the president 's leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick loris says obama may be able to compromise with republicans on some issues so other than the efforts of individual states , the us delegation will arrive at cancun with empty hands .
according to greenpeace climate expert kyle ash , the us government 's strategy prior to the midterm elections was to prolong international negotiations until a us climate treaty was passed .
if obama holds on to this strategy , this could mean another three years of climate stalemate – until the next presidential elections .
yet kyle ash also sees another possibility .
" obama has the legal authority to commit the us to strong targets and to come to agreement on all of the issues in cancun , " he said .
obama could even make financial commitments , since long-term investments do n't have to be passed in their entirety by the current congress .
but ash also says one would have to be particularly optimistic about these prospects given the current political and economic climate .
despite this , the greenpeace expert hopes that obama will seize the initiative after his recent loss in the midterm elections .
" if there 's one issue that 's super important , that affects not just foreign policy but domestic policy in a big way - that 's climate change . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 26.11.2010 eu sets sights low for climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's climate chief thinks agreements are possible on some things , but not a treaty in the wake of last year 's underwhelming result in copenhagen , the european union is going into the climate talks in cancun with few expectations .
a side deal on forestry may be the most to hope for . deutsche welle spoke with connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action , about the prospects of making any real progress towards a treaty to tackle climate change at this year 's summit in cancun , mexico , which runs from november 29 to december 10 , 2010 .
deutsche welle : what are the priorities for the european union at the cancun talks ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions began rising in 2010 , following a slight fall in 2009 due to the economic crisis connie hedegaard : the main agenda for the european union is to get a balanced package of decisions coming out of cancun in order to keep momentum in the international climate negotiations , and to deliver on some of the pledges given by the leaders last year in copenhagen .
due to the lack of legislation coming through the american senate and due to the lack of progress in some other capitals , we can see that although the eu is ready , as we were last year in copenhagen , we will not get an internationally binding deal done by cancun .
but we can try to secure a set of decisions , for instance a framework for forestry .
we could have an agreement on an adaptation framework .
there was some substantial progress on both these issues in the formal negotiations in copenhagen .
we also ought to be able to agree on a framework of principles for how to cooperate on technology .
and , of course , the developed countries must deliver on their financial pledges from copenhagen .
it 's absolutely crucial that the thirty billion dollars promised in fast-start financing for this year , next year and 2012 are actually delivered .
on the subject of forestry , what are you aiming for and what do you think is realistic ?
we are aiming for an agreement that would turn the incentive structure around - for example , for the brazilian farmer , who , today , often has no other choice but to chop down the rainforest if he wants to have a plot where he can cultivate something he and his family can live from .
we want to change that so that in the future you can also gain something from protecting the rainforest , because that is in everybody 's interest .
on the subject of turning funding pledges into reality : what progress would you like to see this time that did n't come about before ?
if you ask the developing countries , they will say they have seen far too many international conferences where developed countries pledged this , that or the other , but they never saw the money coming their way in reality .
this time we must do better .
the developed countries as a group pledged to deliver around 30 billion dollars .
europe said we can account for around a third of that amount .
now when we come to cancun , we will prove that that is exactly what we are going to deliver .
the 27 member states and the commission together will deliver 7.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- and live up to our pledges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't expect much from the us , which did n't pass a climate bill in 2010 how do you see the position of a country like china ?
i think it is difficult to interpret the position of china .
i feel that china is very constructive when i have meetings with their ministers .
they are also very strong in defending the copenhagen accord .
but sometimes i hear signals of backtracking , and , to be honest , it 's a bit confusing .
i think it 's crucially important that china does not hide behind the lack of legislation in the us because china is such a huge player .
and the paradox is that there is so much that china is actually doing at home .
they are addressing energy efficiency and energy intensity , and they will be putting up new targets for renewable energy sources .
for the first time , they will probably have co2 emissions targets .
seen from a european perspective , it would also be preferable for them to engage strongly in the international negotiations .
for many developing countries , what china says is absolutely crucial . so we think it 's very important that they engage , as china is now the world 's biggest emitter .
some recent reports suggested that , although the eu has been successful on paper in reducing emissions , a lot of the emissions have been " exported , " because , in a country like china , for example , a lot of the emissions are caused by producing goods for export ?
it 's of course true that , since 1990 , a lot of our production in europe has been outsourced .
that 's also the reason why it 's so important to get a global deal .
you 're right that if we are just outsourcing production to those who are not part of an internationally binding deal , how much of the problem would we be solving ?
however , it does not change the fact that , in europe , we have also been improving in the field of energy efficiency . along with japan , we are the most energy efficient region of the world .
in our climate and energy package for 2020 , we have set a target of 20 percent renewable energy sources .
we are on track to reach that .
there was such massive disappointment after copenhagen that a lot of people do not have very high expectations for cancun .
do you think , against that background that something really can be achieved to take us further ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to commit to reductions in its emissions europe is working very hard to achieve an ambitious outcome from cancun .
yes , it looks difficult , but i think the sense of urgency should not be any less than prior to copenhagen .
because what has happened since ?
the climate has not improved . we have seen the hottest 12 months in a row ever recorded .
the chance remains with us .
we have to address it .
and for each year we postpone action , the more expensive and the more difficult it 's going to be in the end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 26.11.2010 demand for terrorism insurance grows after government warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's airports are insured by extremus extremus insures against terrorism damages over 25 million euros , limiting its coverage to airports , office towers and other huge investments .
recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .
in 2002 , pool re removed exclusion clauses for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks .
the need for terrorism insurance has become more apparent since the sept .
11 attacks , which also damaged beyond repair the deutsche bank building adjacent to the world trade center .
deutsche bank later found itself in a legal dispute with the allianz and axa insurance companies , which disputed the status of the building as a total loss .
some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 26.11.2010 obama faces an age-old dilemma over how to deal with north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's latest act has brought it closer to us action us president barack obama faces a dilemma shared by many of his predecessors as he considers his options how the united states should react to north korea 's latest provocation . obama will be pondering the same question which has puzzled every us president since 1953 : how do you solve a problem like korea ?
the divided korean peninsula has provided every sitting us president with a dilemma ever since dwight eisenhower brokered an armistice in the korean war .
that act paused but did not officially end a conflict which had raged for almost three years and cost some 36,000 american lives .
due to the fact that no official peace deal was agreed 58 years ago , the two koreas have been living under the shadow of a potential return to war ever since eisenhower 's intervention .
america 's involvement in the war that divided korea along the 38th parallel also continues to this day due to the commitment of the us to protect south korea from any aggression by its communist neighbors in the north .
around 29,000 us troops remain deployed in south korea .
presidents johnson , ford and carter all had run-ins with north korea during their times in office while the more contemporary administrations of bill clinton and both bush presidencies have had to deal with the north 's growing nuclear ambitions .
while skirmishes in the seas around the korean peninsula and small scale attacks on land gave the immediate post-war presidents a real headache , the last three us leaders have found that the increasingly unpredictable north , with its now indisputable yet crude nuclear weapons , has become a completely different problem .
but while the nature of its threat has changed , the question as to how best to deal with north korea endures .
several experts quoted in european media said they believed the north only developed its nuclear program as leverage .
it was a way of blackmailing the west into concessions on sanctions and aid .
but white house incumbents have so far chosen not to find out whether the north 's regime is prepared to use its arsenal as more than just a bargaining chip .
while the shelling of yeonpyeong island by the north and the responding fire from the south on tuesday was the most serious exchange between the two koreas in over a year - the disputed sinking of the south 's corvette " cheonan " in march aside - this incident is just the latest in a long line of skirmishes .
however , the bombing of yeonpyeong comes just a week after the north revealed a nuclear enrichment facility to a group of american scientists so advanced that it shocked the us .
north 's nuclear capability changes complexion of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any military action would likely come from the south president obama is honor-bound to protect south korea , as his predecessors have been , and as such has strongly affirmed his commitment to defend it as part of the alliance which stretches back to the korean war .
the nuclear-powered uss washington aircraft carrier was deployed to the yellow sea off the coast of south korea on wednesday .
but with north korea 's nuclear capability more advanced than first thought , the us president is unwilling to provoke any escalation and has chosen not to reposition any of the 29,000 us troops in the south closer to the de-militarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- .
obama 's options are limited , said glyn ford , a north east asia specialist and author .
many consider it highly unlikely that the us will engage in any military action against the north , partly because of its nuclear capability and partly because it has a huge army of 9.45 million troops .
if the us commitment to south korea 's defense is to be invoked , it will most likely come in the form of support , not direct intervention .
" the military option is still on the table for the us but we 're a long way off from that , " ford told deutsche welle .
ford said records showed that the us was planning preemptive strikes on the north 's nuclear facilities back in 1994 , so this had been considered before .
but the us was not keen to engage in this and has pulled its troops back further into the south .
" if things do escalate , however , it would be easier if it was the south koreans who took the initiative , backed up by us hardware , " ford said .
" it is very unlikely the us would commit ground troops and its umbrella protection policy would probably only stretch to supporting south korean forces . "
sanctions and the freezing of assets also seem to have little effect on the regime given that pyongyang exists largely outside the system of international financial and diplomatic institutions - unlike countries like iran , which have been subject to us pressure through economic channels .
us unlikely to stage attacks in china 's backyard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to maintain friendly relations with china the us is also unlikely to want to anger china , north korea 's only international ally and economic supporter .
while china has called for restraint on the korean peninsula , beijing has refused to issue an outright condemnation of the bombing of yeonpyeong , even as veiled calls to do so from the united states and japan began to circulate .
however , while beijing remains outwardly supportive , it is thought that china is far from happy with the actions of its disruptive neighbor .
" china will actually be quite upset with north korea over this latest incident so the chinese would n't mind seeing north korea punished for this , " said ford .
" however , it is unlikely that they would protest too much if it was the south koreans who retaliated but it would be a different matter if the united states got involved .
that would be quite problematic . "
howard loewen , an asia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said china played a vital role in the current diplomatic initiative together with the us and south korea that aimed at reviving the six-party talks with north korea instead of engaging in a military conflict . " yet , if hostilities should increase and if south korea would ask for american help , the us would be obliged to defend korea , " loewen told deutsche welle .
" the us would thus interfere to stabilize a destabilized region .
the reaction of china to such a move would depend on its diplomatic interaction with the us and south korea beforehand . " still , loewen said he did not think that the united efforts by china , the us and south korea would be fruitless . " due to significant economic interdependencies , all the major players in the region will put all their efforts into a peaceful solution of the current crisis , " he said .
asian expectations put pressure on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's threat could force the south to act alone in its role as a counterweight to chinese power in the region , any reaffirmation of us commitment , even through diplomatic means , could have a galvanizing effect on america 's asian allies .
" the asian allies expect the us to act as a smooth and diplomatic balance toward china 's rise in the region , " said loewen . " underlining its commitment to south korea shows the other allies that they can rely on the us .
if a war situation emerges , the actual us engagement will depend on the interaction of the major powers in the region and us domestic politics . "
but with the us unlikely to take military action against north korea , some experts believe that its commitment toward its allies in asia may be seen by some countries as wavering .
the knock-on effect on regional stability could be just as damaging in the long term as an air strike .
both south korea and japan have long been opposed to developing their own nuclear weapons , despite the threat emanating from north korea , instead relying on their conventional forces and us commitments to their defense .
should the us weigh up the myriad potential problems arising from launching strikes on north korea and chose to pursue different routes , some experts say south korea and even japan - the victim of two nuclear strikes at the end of world war ii - would reconsider their position .
" korean and japanese plans of going it alone in this respect have always been mitigated by the us government , " loewen said .
" surely , if the conflict between the two koreas would escalate and no american support would follow , both states would consider other defensive options .
however , this is not very likely . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warning comes days after four people were killed when north korean shells rained down on a south korean island . as if to prove that its threats are far from empty , north korea reportedly staged a firing drill on friday near the border with south korea . a south korean defense ministry spokesman said that explosions had been heard for about three hours in the early afternoon and they appeared to be from the north . there were no details about where the shells had landed but the exercise and north korea 's latest warnings sent a chill across south korea 's outposts . bildunterschrift : many inhabitants have now left yeonpyeong for the mainland their fear is not unfounded considering tuesday 's deadly attack on the tiny fishing and garrison island of yeonpyeong that killed four people , including two civilians , and wounded 18 more .
dozens of houses were reduced to rubble . the island , parts of which now resemble a warzone according to reports , has apparently emptied .
there are mainly troops and local officials left . islanders on other more distant outposts , such as baengnyeong near the spot where the south korean cheonan warship was sunk in march , fear they could be next . many residents have already tried to escape by taking crowded ferries to the mainland .
some were reportedly not able to buy tickets as the boats were fully booked . those who have to stay behind have stocked up on supplies such as water , instant food , blankets and candles . new defense minister in seoul a us aircraft carrier group is being sent to the yellow sea to join south korea 's navy for a four-day joint exercise that is set to start on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of houses were reduced to rubble but pyongyang warned on friday that north korea 's army would bring down " a shower of dreadful fire " if its enemies encroach upon its " dignity and sovereignty even in the least . " one of the first tasks of south korea ’ s new defense minister , kim kwan-jin , a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff appointed on friday , will be to decide upon how to react to any future provocation . on thursday , south korean defense minister kim tae-young resigned after coming under fire for the army ’ s apparently slow response to tuesday ’ s attack . the south fired 80 shells at the north 's coastal artillery positions but it did not call in air strikes , apparently to avoid increasing the tension even more . " we suspect that the north sustained considerable damage , " a south korean military official said . the south has since decided to send in more troops and guns to five frontline islands and has said it will change the rules of engagement so that the military can hit back harder in case of future attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the son of kim oh-bock , right , was killed in the attack on tuesday hard-liners call for harsher response hard-line protesters in south korea 's capital have been calling on the government to react with more force to pyongyang in general . " we should not be scared of the enemy , " one demonstrator said .
" our people has to be unified so that we can fight back with full force .
conservative groups like us and the older generation that remembers the korean war have come here to show our solidarity . " however , other more left-wing south koreans say that president lee myung-bak ’ s hard-line attitude over the past two years is to blame for the current tension on the korean peninsula . act / afp / reuters / dpa editor : manasi gopalakrishnan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 26.11.2010 eu sets sights low for climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's climate chief thinks agreements are possible on some things , but not a treaty in the wake of last year 's underwhelming result in copenhagen , the european union is going into the climate talks in cancun with few expectations .
a side deal on forestry may be the most to hope for . deutsche welle spoke with connie hedegaard , the eu commissioner for climate action , about the prospects of making any real progress towards a treaty to tackle climate change at this year 's summit in cancun , mexico , which runs from november 29 to december 10 , 2010 .
deutsche welle : what are the priorities for the european union at the cancun talks ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions began rising in 2010 , following a slight fall in 2009 due to the economic crisis connie hedegaard : the main agenda for the european union is to get a balanced package of decisions coming out of cancun in order to keep momentum in the international climate negotiations , and to deliver on some of the pledges given by the leaders last year in copenhagen .
due to the lack of legislation coming through the american senate and due to the lack of progress in some other capitals , we can see that although the eu is ready , as we were last year in copenhagen , we will not get an internationally binding deal done by cancun .
but we can try to secure a set of decisions , for instance a framework for forestry .
we could have an agreement on an adaptation framework .
there was some substantial progress on both these issues in the formal negotiations in copenhagen .
we also ought to be able to agree on a framework of principles for how to cooperate on technology .
and , of course , the developed countries must deliver on their financial pledges from copenhagen .
it 's absolutely crucial that the thirty billion dollars promised in fast-start financing for this year , next year and 2012 are actually delivered .
on the subject of forestry , what are you aiming for and what do you think is realistic ?
we are aiming for an agreement that would turn the incentive structure around - for example , for the brazilian farmer , who , today , often has no other choice but to chop down the rainforest if he wants to have a plot where he can cultivate something he and his family can live from .
we want to change that so that in the future you can also gain something from protecting the rainforest , because that is in everybody 's interest .
on the subject of turning funding pledges into reality : what progress would you like to see this time that did n't come about before ?
if you ask the developing countries , they will say they have seen far too many international conferences where developed countries pledged this , that or the other , but they never saw the money coming their way in reality .
this time we must do better .
the developed countries as a group pledged to deliver around 30 billion dollars .
europe said we can account for around a third of that amount .
now when we come to cancun , we will prove that that is exactly what we are going to deliver .
the 27 member states and the commission together will deliver 7.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- and live up to our pledges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does n't expect much from the us , which did n't pass a climate bill in 2010 how do you see the position of a country like china ?
i think it is difficult to interpret the position of china .
i feel that china is very constructive when i have meetings with their ministers .
they are also very strong in defending the copenhagen accord .
but sometimes i hear signals of backtracking , and , to be honest , it 's a bit confusing .
i think it 's crucially important that china does not hide behind the lack of legislation in the us because china is such a huge player .
and the paradox is that there is so much that china is actually doing at home .
they are addressing energy efficiency and energy intensity , and they will be putting up new targets for renewable energy sources .
for the first time , they will probably have co2 emissions targets .
seen from a european perspective , it would also be preferable for them to engage strongly in the international negotiations .
for many developing countries , what china says is absolutely crucial . so we think it 's very important that they engage , as china is now the world 's biggest emitter .
some recent reports suggested that , although the eu has been successful on paper in reducing emissions , a lot of the emissions have been " exported , " because , in a country like china , for example , a lot of the emissions are caused by producing goods for export ?
it 's of course true that , since 1990 , a lot of our production in europe has been outsourced .
that 's also the reason why it 's so important to get a global deal .
you 're right that if we are just outsourcing production to those who are not part of an internationally binding deal , how much of the problem would we be solving ?
however , it does not change the fact that , in europe , we have also been improving in the field of energy efficiency . along with japan , we are the most energy efficient region of the world .
in our climate and energy package for 2020 , we have set a target of 20 percent renewable energy sources .
we are on track to reach that .
there was such massive disappointment after copenhagen that a lot of people do not have very high expectations for cancun .
do you think , against that background that something really can be achieved to take us further ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to commit to reductions in its emissions europe is working very hard to achieve an ambitious outcome from cancun .
yes , it looks difficult , but i think the sense of urgency should not be any less than prior to copenhagen .
because what has happened since ?
the climate has not improved . we have seen the hottest 12 months in a row ever recorded .
the chance remains with us .
we have to address it .
and for each year we postpone action , the more expensive and the more difficult it 's going to be in the end .

the country 's political system is relatively chaotic , but it 's the only hope for bringing improvement to the western hemisphere 's poorest nation . ahead of haiti 's presidential and parliamentary election scheduled on sunday , there were numerous calls to postpone the poll following a string of violent incidents and concerns about voter participation .
as preparations got underway , skeptics were asking how many of the country 's 4.7 million eligible voters would even be able to cast their ballots .
and , on friday evening , gunmen opened fire at the final campaign rally of one candidate , the musician michel martelly .
local media reported that one person had been killed and several injured .
the incident is the latest event to underscore the difficulties surrounding the election . earlier in the week , gunmen attacked a motorcade belonging to the ruling party 's candidate , while there were reports of barricades being erected in one southern town to keep out electoral registration officials accused of being corrupt .
nonetheless , most of those involved , as well as a majority of international observers , are calling for the elections to go ahead , citing the need for political stability in haiti .
previous haitian elections have failed to result in political stability . that , experts say , is the result of the specific social situation in haiti .
defective democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been sporadic acts of violence in the run-up to the vote haiti 's election features a recognizable democratic structure , but lacks some essential democratic content .
" political parties in the european sense are relatively rare , " guenther maihold , deputy director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the parties are more often collective movements around individual candidates , and the main organizational principle is the clientele system .
this constellation encourages systematic corruption . "
other experts concur with that assessment .
" parties often only exist in the run-up to elections , " oliver gliech , a haiti expert who teaches at berlin 's free university , explained .
" there are few overarching organizations , and thus it 's difficult to build political consensus to overcome clientele politics . "
the list of presidential candidates for the election is long enough to frustrate any quick overview .
among the leading contenders are martelly , the industrialist charles henri baker , former haitian first lady mirlande maginat and jude celestin , the preferred successor of outgoing president rene preval .
but gliech cautions against concluding that haiti is a failed state in the sense of a somalia or afghanistan .
instead , he terms the island nation a " defective democracy . "
and the root of those deficiencies is historical .
the black republic bildunterschrift : the badly damaged national palace is a symbol of haiti 's dysfunctional state a former french colony , haiti achieved independence relatively early on after a slave rebellion in 1804 , and gliech points out that at least in terms of its legal framework , the country does not lag that far behind the norms of europe .
but haiti also suffers from the continuing legacy of slavery and the demise of the plantation system .
" without question , the atomization of political life , the over-emphasis on particular interests among elites , unwillingness to form coalitions and lack of trust in the state are latter-day remnants of the colonial past , " gliech wrote in an essay published earlier this year .
that has meant that in the past the military often deposed elected leaders , or that haitian presidents , having to battle a majority , if divided opposition , have resorted to dictatorial means to maintain power .
" in order to form a stable government , the haitian president has to unite two political moments , " maihold explained .
" he has to negotiate with the parliament to install a prime minister , and he has to align himself with a host of local strongmen . "
the precarious social position of the executive helps account for why haiti lacks a stable and effective government , a fact that became all too tragically apparent earlier this year .
the best and only chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : systematic problems have hindered haitian reconstruction the experts agree that the weakness of the haitian government is one major reason why last winter 's earthquake and this autumn 's cholera outbreak have been so devastating .
although international aid has poured into haiti , the weak state has had difficulty coordinating it - to say nothing of laying the groundwork for lasting social improvements .
as an example , gliech cites the fact that although ordinances for building earthquake-proof houses exist , there are no authorities able to enforce them .
this has led to political apathy and anger among the general population .
yet democratic elections remain haiti 's best , and perhaps only , chance .
" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

men have twice the rate of leukemia and women have three times the rate of thyroid cancer . newly published figures from the lower saxony state cancer registry show that in the area around asse , the site of a controversial nuclear waste dump near wolffenbuettel , some cancer rates are higher than normal . between 2002 and 2009 there were 12 cases of leukemia in the greater asse region .
the area had twice the rate expected for men .
while there was no significant increase in leukemia for women , their rate of thyroid cancer was three times as high as normal . the government has not yet determined if the increase is related to the proximity to the nuclear waste site .
a working group of representatives from lower saxony ’ s environment , social , and health ministries as well as the federal agency for radiation protection is set to meet over the next few weeks to take a closer look at the data . joerg roehmann , the district administrator in wolfenbuettel , said in an interview with german public television that the numbers needed to be analyzed and put into context before any conclusions can be made . " i 'd like to appeal to anyone from this area who has been diagnosed with leukemia , for example , to come forward , along with doctors or anyone treating these patients to help us make comparisons and create a context for this data , " he said . " we do n't know anything about exact location , age , occupation , or family history in these cases . " no blame yet asse was originally a salt mine .
between 1967 and 1978 around 126,000 drums of waste were stored in the facility .
more recently it 's been declared unstable because of a danger of collapse and water leaks and is due to be emptied out and shut down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is stored in a former salt mine ursula kleber is on the board of directors of a non-profit organization called aufpassen , a play on words with asse and the german word ' aufpassen , ' meaning ' to take care of . ' aufpassen addresses problems and concerns relating to the site . " because of asse , we 're pretty nervous around here , " kleber told deutsche welle " so it 's good that this investigation is taking place .
but we do n't have enough information yet to say this was caused by asse . " statistical variance while the exact cause of the higher leukemia and thyroid cancer rates are being examined , it is important to note that the actual number of cases reported is relatively small . in the seven years covered in the newly released statistics , 12 cases of leukemia in men were reported from the greater asse area .
the average is five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radiation levels are carefully monitored at asse dr. stefanie seltmann from the german cancer research center in heidelberg told deutsche welle that these numbers are not necessarily cause for alarm . " if you assume that there are about 10,000 small communities like this in germany , " she said , " then strictly from a standpoint of statistical variation , if five cases is average , some communities will have 12 while others wo n't have any , without any particular reason such as radiation . " it is slightly more concerning that in every year surveyed this statistical variation existed , but dr. seltmann says it could all turn out to be just a coincidence . with such a small sample group , definitive answers will have to wait a few more weeks for the conclusion of the working group in lower saxony . author : matt zuvela , holly fox -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" haiti needs legitimate authorities , and the international community should not be functioning as a kind of replacement government , " maihold said .
" the election could help dissipate the anger at foreign aid workers , whom nationalists sometimes unfortunately portray as intruders in the country . "
recent weeks have seen isolated attacks on foreign peacekeepers and aid workers , whom some haitians blame for their continuing misery - and even for bringing the cholera virus to haiti .
" it is absolutely crucial to shore up governmental institutions and create constitutional normality , " gliech said .
" what are the alternatives ?
civil society is hardly in the position to rebuild the country , and private industry , which often exploits ordinary haitians , is by no means able to . "
no one expects this weekend 's election to be a cure-all . but it may represent a faint ray of hope for a nation that has seen far , far more than its fair share of dark clouds in 2010 .

the jury is still out as to how dangerous bpa really is . beginning in 2011 , both the manufacture and sale of baby bottles containing the chemical bisphenol-a -lrb- bpa -rrb- will be banned across the european union , the european commission said on thursday .
" the decision … is good news for european parents who can be sure that as of mid-2011 plastic infant feeding bottles will not include bpa , " said john dalli , the commissioner in charge of health and consumer policy , in a statement .
from march 1 , 2011 , the manufacture of such bottles will be illegal within the eu , and from june 1 , 2011 , it will no longer be legal for bpa bottles produced abroad to be imported to the eu or sold on the european market .
how dangerous is bpa ?
bpa is widely used in plastic containers and packaging around the world .
although studies have linked bpa exposure to cancer , obesity and the early onset of puberty , its risks are still disputed .
the european food safety agency recently issued a report on the chemical , saying that it was safe in small quantities and yet admitting areas of uncertainty .
" it can not be excluded that there might be an effect on the development , immune response or tumor promotion , " dalli said in an october 7 statement .
france and denmark are the only two eu countries to already have a ban on bpa bottles in place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.11.2010 on match day 14 , dw pundits have it hands down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like a scam ... but at least it 's an inexpensive one the dw pundits have searched high and low for the right stuff in their bundesliga preditictions this season .
but perhaps the answers were right on their palms all along .
or so goes the latest scheme ... the dw bundesliga pundits have had it with eastern wisdom .
all the deep breathing and lotus positioning we did last week brought nothing but a few close-but-no-cigar picks and an achy back .
either it 's all rubbish , or the garnering of good karma is n't so instant after all .
in any case , we 're back to our old tricks - feeding slugs into penny arcade machines in hope that they really can tell us nine correct scores , all by the lines on our greasy palms .
friday , november 26 mainz - nuremberg with five wins , five losses , three draws , and sitting in 10th place , nuremberg come pretty close to setting the standard for mediocrity in the bundesliga .
they have enough ball skill and goal-scoring threat in players like julian schieber , mehmet ekici , and ilkay guendogan to stay competitive in most matches , but that 's not enough to put the hammer down on anybody .
in other words , they 've played a lot of close matches .
mainz have too - eight of their 13 games so far have been one-goal margin affairs - but there 's a difference : mainz usually win .
prediction : 2-1 mainz saturday , nov .
27 bayern munich - frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez should be skipping and jumping again on saturday eintracht is one of bayern 's bogey teams – the frankfurters have managed to get a win or a draw off the bundesliga goliaths in five of the last seven years in which they 've been in the top flight together .
often it 's an all-out display of bunkering in which their keeper plays the hero .
-lrb- see oka nikolov 's 38-save performance of 3 november 2007 for details . -rrb-
this time around , things should be different .
first off , frankfurt are in the unusual position of looking down at the bavarians in the table .
and second , in michael skibbe they now have a coach who likes his team to play football .
this should make for an exciting match , but a likely loss for the “ moody diva . ”
prediction : 3-2 bayern hamburg - stuttgart hamburg 's season began with the promise of a new coach , a squad that was finally healthy , and a dance card free of european distraction .
hopes were high – some were even talking about the title .
all that has evaporated , as armin veh looks like he 's in over his head , the injury bug struck back with a vengeance , and the lack of midweek games became grounds for second-stringers to grumble about not getting a game .
their saving grace in this week 's match is that stuttgart look even worse .
if you lose at home to cologne , as the swabians did last week , you are in a world of trouble . prediction : 3-1 hamburg hoffenheim - leverkusen this match pits last year 's late-season swoon specialists against those of two years ago .
each has let success go to its head in past years , but this season they are both quietly putting together solid runs of results that should see them in the hunt for champions league spots through to the end .
moreover , each is capable of attractive football . we reckon with a draw in the rhein-neckar arena .
prediction : 2-2 draw hanover - freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka deserves a round of applause of his own there are no two bigger surprises in the bundesliga than hanover and freiburg .
each squeaked to top-flight safety in the season 's closing weeks - stunning most observers - and today both are sitting pretty in the top six - to the even greater shock of the soccer pundit class .
it 's not down to any blockbuster buys either - each side 's game-changer -lrb- hanover 's didier ya konan and freiburg 's papiss demba cisse -rrb- are in their second season at their respective club .
perhaps all it took was a little time for the teams to gel around their stars , and a little more time to learn from these clubs ' underrated coaches , robin dutt and mirko slomka .
there 's not much in this one , but home field advantage will give an edge to slomka 's men .
prediction : hanover 2-1 kaiserslautern - schalke speaking of home field advantage , there is no tougher atmosphere for a visiting team to overcome than that on the betzenberg .
the 50,000-capacity stadium is sold out for this one , but schalke is a team that ‘ travels ' well .
expect several thousand fans to turn up to support the royal blues , and expect them to be doing a lot of cheering if their team plays anything like as well as they did against olympique lyon at mid-week .
kaiserslautern have improved in recent weeks , but not enough to stop a resurgent schalke .
prediction : 3-1 schalke dortmund - moenchengladbach we could tell you about how gladbach has played dortmund close over the years , going down by more than a goal just three times in the last decade , and getting four wins to boot .
we could tell you how gladbach were unlucky to lose last week against mainz , and have actually looked good for three weeks running now .
we could tell you that dortmund is due for a dip in form .
but all that would be rank speculation .
this is the first place team playing at home against the last place team , and we 're not going to over-think this .
prediction : 2-0 dortmund sunday , nov .
28 bremen - st. pauli times are tough in bremen .
they tailspun out of the champions league this week , are winless in their last four matches in the league , and the local papers are filled with talk of crisis , seasoned with news of injuries -lrb- wesley is the latest -rrb- and tales of misbehavior from the bundesliga 's no. 1 head-case marko arnautovic .
st. pauli , meanwhile , have been sliding down the table more quietly .
after a strong start that saw them up to sixth after eight matches , they 've done little but lose and find themselves in 14th - just where most of us expected to find them .
if football games could end in scores with negative numbers , we 'd pick that .
prediction : 1-1 draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dzeko 's nine goals so far have lifted wolfsburg to a so-so 11th place cologne - wolfsburg wolfsburg are a frustrating side .
with the potent likes of diego , edin dzeko , and grafite assaulting opposing defenses , the wolves ought to have put up big numbers - and indeed so far they 've notched a respectable 21 goals , sixth in the league .
trouble is , they 've let in a fifth-worst 22 , and their habit of letting in goals in the last half hour has seen them turn wins into draws , or draws into losses , five times already this season .
cologne battled their way to a win last week in stuttgart , but have thus far been incapable of putting two good results in a row .
prediction : 2-1 wolfsburg last week 's results : 4 points schalke - bremen 4-0 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- frankfurt - hoffenheim 0-4 -lrb- dw prediction 0-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach - mainz 2-3 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- freiburg - dortmund 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-3 -rrb- hanover - hamburg 3-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- nuremberg - kaiserslautern 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 1-0 -rrb- leverkusen - bayern 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-2 -rrb- stuttgart - cologne 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 3-0 -rrb- st. pauli - wolfsburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction 0-2 -rrb- total for the season : 58 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

new delhi accused islamabad of failing in its promise to punish the alleged masterminds . when gunmen targeted india 's financial hub and symbol of the country ’ s economic rise on november 26 2008 , the media were quick to describe the carefully-orchestrated attacks as india ’ s " 9/11 . "
they soon became known as india ’ s " 26/11 . "
two years later , the wounds have not healed , says security expert afsar karim in new delhi : " this is because those behind the attacks have not yet been brought to justice .
the threat , which emanates from pakistan , has not lessened because pakistan has not acted against the terror groups which operated from its territory .
a wound can only heal if there is no danger that something like this will be repeated . " bildunterschrift : gunmen assailed mumbai 's victoria central station and several other buildings on " 26/11 " the attacks did little to improve the already tense relations between india and pakistan .
the only surviving gunman ajmal amir kasab , who is pakistani , has said that the officially banned pakistan-based terror group , lashkar-e-taiba , was behind the bloodbath . new delhi has accused islamabad of being slow to look into the cause of the attacks and of conducting its investigation half-heartedly .
lashkar-e-taiba and its head hafiz saeed are thought to have close connections to pakistan 's secret services . delhi claims the highest circles in pakistan must have been aware of the plans to attack mumbai . better relations needed between india and pakistan " i am one of those who think it is important for the whole region that india and pakistan have good relations , " says amitabh mattoo , a political expert at new delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university . " for india as an aspiring nation it is very important to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors .
four years ago , there were some good talks with pakistan under former president musharraf and many thought this might lead to a breakthrough . " but after the mumbai attacks , india wanted pakistan to act against lashkar-e-taiba and yet the founders are still running free , holding speeches all over the country .
if the pakistani government doesn ’ t change its attitude , the instability will go on . " slow implementation of reforms after the attacks , the indian government announced it would invest more in security and prevention .
police reforms were introduced and the media , which were accused of playing into the hands of the terrorists with their reporting , agreed to act according to a code of honor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian home minister p. chidambaram paid tribute to the victims on the second anniversary they said that they would censor themselves at times of crisis and not talk about security plans for instance . " there have been reforms but these have perhaps not been implemented as fast as we would have liked , " explained afsar karim .

in fact , many have already left , looking for better prospects overseas . at a ' show your business week ' fair in the center of dublin , irish entrepreneurs have been showcasing their products and services , hoping to give their businesses a boost .
right in the middle of town , the exhibition gave these firms a prime spot to advertise .
but that wo n't be enough to change their fortunes as trading conditions in ireland have become incredibly difficult .
jimmy o 'reilly is one of them .
he has had to cut his workforce of laborers from eight to two at the small building firm he runs .
he has considered moving his business abroad .
but for now , he 's staying .
" unfortunately we have two kids here , and i 'm a bit loyal to ireland , " he said .
" i think we 'll stick with it and make an effort to keep it afloat . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the food industry , you move where the work is it 's easy for people to move their businesses within the european union , says neil barrett , who owns a food start-up .
" it 's a common market , so it 's as close to london as it is to cork , so you 'll move wherever it works .
because you have to . "
things are so bad , barrett says that it 's understandable that entrepreneurs would consider emigrating .
" this is a food business , and the food business is probably the toughest business around anyway , and this is probably the roughest year that any of us has ever lived through , and next year 's probably going to be worse . "
all talk ?
just how many people will up and leave ireland for better prospects elsewhere is impossible to say , but james wickham , a migration expert at trinity college dublin , says almost everyone is talking about it .
" it 's an absolutely standard thing for us in education to say , ' well all my students are talking about leaving . '
how many people have actually left is not clear , although it 's unambiguous that the number is rising .
there is a sort of general atmosphere of ' oh my god , i 'm getting out . '
" those statistics that are available suggest the numbers are already high .
according to the economic and social research institute , irish emigration jumped by 40 percent to 65,000 in the year to april 2010 .
it predicts 200,000 people will emigrate by 2015 .
student exodus the economic downturn in ireland is particularly worrying for students who wonder whether they will find jobs once they 've finished their studies .
ireland 's union of students predicts 150,000 young people will choose to leave the country to find work in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are expected to leave ireland in droves professor wickham says emigrating is not seen as a big deal by young irish people .
" this has happened before .
in the 1980s i can remember saying to my students ' last one out , turn out the light . '
" he pointed out that ireland , like poland , has for a long time been a country where " young people do n't think twice - or they think twice but not three times - before they emigrate . "
" we are a society where it is normal to leave .
if you talk to young germans in the middle of a recession - they do n't leave , " he said .
but wickham put a positive spin on the possibility of thousands of skilled workers leaving the country .
" one of the things we 've learnt from the last mass emigration is that people come back , and people travel backwards and forwards , " he said .
" the gains from emigration - from people coming back , from people setting up new concepts from business contacts , intellectual contacts , cultural contacts , professional contacts - you know those are real benefits . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.11.2010 swedish court turns down pirate bay appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate bay currently has over 24 million users a swedish appeals court on friday upheld a ruling against three men behind file-sharing website pirate bay , cutting their prison sentences and raising the fine . so far , the file-sharing platform pirate bay - the " world 's most resilient bittorrent site , " as it bills itself - is still live .
but its days may be numbered , thanks to a verdict handed down on friday in a swedish appeals court .
a lower court had last year sentenced four men who co-founded and ran pirate bay to one year in jail and a total fine of 32 million crowns -lrb- $ 4.57 million , or 3.45 million euros -rrb- .
the svea appeals court said in a statement on friday it had reduced the prison sentences by varying degrees , but raised the fine to 46 million crowns .
the new judgement related only to three men - peter sunde , fredrik neij and carl lundstrom - as a fourth , gottfrid svartholm warg , was ill and could not take part in the proceedings .
marten schultz , law professor at the university of uppsala , was unsurprised by the verdict .
" most lawyers are not that surprised that they were convicted , " he told deutsche welle .
" what is maybe a bit surprising is that the amount of damages was so high .
it 's really incredibly high - a really staggering amount . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde faces an even heftier fine schultz said that safeguards usually used to protect private citizens in similar cases had been bypassed .
christian engstrom , member of the european parliament for the pirate party , a civil liberties party that has made a flagship cause of the pirate bay case , the verdict proved that corporations have too much influence in swedish law courts .
" it 's very disappointing , because it proves that when it comes to corporate cases , you ca n't trust the swedish legal system , " he told deutsche welle after the ruling was announced in stockholm .
" the lawyers for the record companies are friends with the judges , both in the lower court and in the appeals court .
they belong to the same societies for copyright , which is a lobby organization for copyright lawyers .
this corruption unfortunately leads to the fact that you ca n't get a fair trial in copyright-related issues in sweden today . "
confidence problems " generally speaking , i do have a lot of confidence in the swedish system , " engstrom added .
" but i was hoping for a different verdict - i was hoping the appeal court would re-establish , or at least start the work of re-establishing confidence in the swedish court system in copyright issues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep engstrom , right , believes the swedish courts ca n't be trusted predictably , the music industry is taking a very different view .
frances moore , chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- , was particularly uncompromising when the judgement was announced .
" today 's judgment confirms the illegality of the pirate bay and the seriousness of the crimes of those involved , " moore said .
" it is now time for the pirate bay , whose operators have twice been convicted in court , to close . we now look to governments and internet service providers to take note of this judgment , do the responsible thing and take the necessary steps to get the pirate bay shut down . "
higher court the district court had ordered them to pay the damages to a number of content providers , including warner bros , sony music entertainment , emi und columbia pictures . the providers had sought 117 million crowns - substantially more than the 46 million they were awarded .
the four defendants claimed they can not be held responsible for the material exchanged via their site , which was launched in 2003 , since no copyrighted material is stored on its servers and no exchange of files actually takes place there .
but the prosecution argued that by financing , programming and administering the site , the four men promoted the infringement of property rights by its users .
friday 's verdict means the defendants must now decide whether to take their case to a higher court .
" at the press conference , one of the judges was asked whether the case contains elements which would make it likely that the supreme court would take it , " engstrom said .
" and she said , ' yes it does . '
so in all likelihood this will go to the supreme court . "
bank robbers use roads , right ?
one of the most important of these elements is what is known as ‘ secondary liability ' - the extent to which pirate bay is responsible for illegal activity carried out through its site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry wants the pirate bay shut down " the core issue is whether any service provider can be sentenced for what people who use the service do , " said engstrom .
" it 's important to remember that pirate bay is used to share a lot of material completely legally .
it 's potentially very damaging to the internet as a whole that the providers of infrastructure ca n't know if they will be held liable for what other people do . "
" messenger immunity has been a guiding principle since roman times , " engstrom pointed out .
" all kinds of infrastructure are used to commit crimes .
bank robbers use the roads , people send drugs through the postal service .
if you start making service providers liable for what people do with the services , it significantly increases the legal uncertainty . "
pirate bay - which currently has over 24 million users - organizes the exchange of so-called bittorrent data , small packets of data which allow the transfer of much larger files direct from one computer to another . the site explicitly leaves it up to the person doing the downloading to clarify copyright issues , including payment .

the divided korean peninsula has provided every sitting us president with a dilemma ever since dwight eisenhower brokered an armistice in the korean war .
that act paused but did not officially end a conflict which had raged for almost three years and cost some 36,000 american lives .
due to the fact that no official peace deal was agreed 58 years ago , the two koreas have been living under the shadow of a potential return to war ever since eisenhower 's intervention .
america 's involvement in the war that divided korea along the 38th parallel also continues to this day due to the commitment of the us to protect south korea from any aggression by its communist neighbors in the north .
around 29,000 us troops remain deployed in south korea .
presidents johnson , ford and carter all had run-ins with north korea during their times in office while the more contemporary administrations of bill clinton and both bush presidencies have had to deal with the north 's growing nuclear ambitions .
while skirmishes in the seas around the korean peninsula and small scale attacks on land gave the immediate post-war presidents a real headache , the last three us leaders have found that the increasingly unpredictable north , with its now indisputable yet crude nuclear weapons , has become a completely different problem .
but while the nature of its threat has changed , the question as to how best to deal with north korea endures .
several experts quoted in european media said they believed the north only developed its nuclear program as leverage .
it was a way of blackmailing the west into concessions on sanctions and aid .
but white house incumbents have so far chosen not to find out whether the north 's regime is prepared to use its arsenal as more than just a bargaining chip .
while the shelling of yeonpyeong island by the north and the responding fire from the south on tuesday was the most serious exchange between the two koreas in over a year - the disputed sinking of the south 's corvette " cheonan " in march aside - this incident is just the latest in a long line of skirmishes .
however , the bombing of yeonpyeong comes just a week after the north revealed a nuclear enrichment facility to a group of american scientists so advanced that it shocked the us .
north 's nuclear capability changes complexion of crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any military action would likely come from the south president obama is honor-bound to protect south korea , as his predecessors have been , and as such has strongly affirmed his commitment to defend it as part of the alliance which stretches back to the korean war .
the nuclear-powered uss washington aircraft carrier was deployed to the yellow sea off the coast of south korea on wednesday .
but with north korea 's nuclear capability more advanced than first thought , the us president is unwilling to provoke any escalation and has chosen not to reposition any of the 29,000 us troops in the south closer to the de-militarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- .
obama 's options are limited , said glyn ford , a north east asia specialist and author .
many consider it highly unlikely that the us will engage in any military action against the north , partly because of its nuclear capability and partly because it has a huge army of 9.45 million troops .
if the us commitment to south korea 's defense is to be invoked , it will most likely come in the form of support , not direct intervention .
" the military option is still on the table for the us but we 're a long way off from that , " ford told deutsche welle .
ford said records showed that the us was planning preemptive strikes on the north 's nuclear facilities back in 1994 , so this had been considered before .
but the us was not keen to engage in this and has pulled its troops back further into the south .
" if things do escalate , however , it would be easier if it was the south koreans who took the initiative , backed up by us hardware , " ford said .
" it is very unlikely the us would commit ground troops and its umbrella protection policy would probably only stretch to supporting south korean forces . "
sanctions and the freezing of assets also seem to have little effect on the regime given that pyongyang exists largely outside the system of international financial and diplomatic institutions - unlike countries like iran , which have been subject to us pressure through economic channels .
us unlikely to stage attacks in china 's backyard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to maintain friendly relations with china the us is also unlikely to want to anger china , north korea 's only international ally and economic supporter .
while china has called for restraint on the korean peninsula , beijing has refused to issue an outright condemnation of the bombing of yeonpyeong , even as veiled calls to do so from the united states and japan began to circulate .
however , while beijing remains outwardly supportive , it is thought that china is far from happy with the actions of its disruptive neighbor .
" china will actually be quite upset with north korea over this latest incident so the chinese would n't mind seeing north korea punished for this , " said ford .
" however , it is unlikely that they would protest too much if it was the south koreans who retaliated but it would be a different matter if the united states got involved .
that would be quite problematic . "
howard loewen , an asia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said china played a vital role in the current diplomatic initiative together with the us and south korea that aimed at reviving the six-party talks with north korea instead of engaging in a military conflict . " yet , if hostilities should increase and if south korea would ask for american help , the us would be obliged to defend korea , " loewen told deutsche welle .
" the us would thus interfere to stabilize a destabilized region .
the reaction of china to such a move would depend on its diplomatic interaction with the us and south korea beforehand . " still , loewen said he did not think that the united efforts by china , the us and south korea would be fruitless . " due to significant economic interdependencies , all the major players in the region will put all their efforts into a peaceful solution of the current crisis , " he said .
asian expectations put pressure on obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's threat could force the south to act alone in its role as a counterweight to chinese power in the region , any reaffirmation of us commitment , even through diplomatic means , could have a galvanizing effect on america 's asian allies .
" the asian allies expect the us to act as a smooth and diplomatic balance toward china 's rise in the region , " said loewen . " underlining its commitment to south korea shows the other allies that they can rely on the us .
if a war situation emerges , the actual us engagement will depend on the interaction of the major powers in the region and us domestic politics . "
but with the us unlikely to take military action against north korea , some experts believe that its commitment toward its allies in asia may be seen by some countries as wavering .
the knock-on effect on regional stability could be just as damaging in the long term as an air strike .
both south korea and japan have long been opposed to developing their own nuclear weapons , despite the threat emanating from north korea , instead relying on their conventional forces and us commitments to their defense .
should the us weigh up the myriad potential problems arising from launching strikes on north korea and chose to pursue different routes , some experts say south korea and even japan - the victim of two nuclear strikes at the end of world war ii - would reconsider their position .
" korean and japanese plans of going it alone in this respect have always been mitigated by the us government , " loewen said .
" surely , if the conflict between the two koreas would escalate and no american support would follow , both states would consider other defensive options .
however , this is not very likely . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .

some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 26.11.2010 germany lags behind pledges in development aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin stands accused of pursuing its own interests in its development policies germany is set to spend 6.2 billion euros on development aid in 2011 , more than ever before .
despite the unprecedented figure , however , the amount is still below berlin 's millennium development aid pledge . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has announced its aid budget for 2011 , which will see berlin spend 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- on helping developing countries .
that 's the highest figure that germany has ever spent on development aid . but opposition parties in the bundestag have criticized the pledge , saying it is well below the amount berlin promised as part of the millennium development goals set out by the united nations to fight global hunger , child mortality and disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel has been criticized from all sides for his policies the 6.2 billion euros accounts for around 0.35 percent of germany 's gross domestic product ; yet , at the millennium summit in new york in 2000 , germany pledged to allocate 0.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the development targets .
but if there 's anything the german development minister is used to hearing from the opposition , it is criticism .
a year after taking up his post in berlin , dirk niebel is often reminded by political adversaries and journalists of his free democratic party 's stated intent -lrb- while it was in opposition -rrb- to abolish the development ministry - or rather to incorporate it into the foreign ministry .
niebel was accused of using the development ministry as a guise to pursue germany 's economic interests abroad , in countries where lucrative business deals are waiting to be made in infrastructure - one of the core areas of germany 's economy .
' contract purchasing ' green party politician thilo hoppe , as the deputy head of the bundestag 's development committee , accused niebel 's ministry of promoting a " paradigmatic turn " in the development ministry 's mission .
he told deutsche welle he was not against economic involvement in public-private partnerships , but objected to the current projects that place too much emphasis on germany 's economic interests in development projects .
as an example , hoppe referred specifically to germany 's support of the meyer shipyard in northern germany , which , with help from the development ministry has been able to secure a lucrative contract in indonesia .
the deal concerns a ferry boat , in which hoppe said germany is investing 49 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo hoppe told parliament that the development ministry was ' purchasing contracts ' " without the government development subsidy , the meyer shipyard would have no chance of winning this contract .
now it can still apply , for the deal has yet to be agreed .
if the meyer shipyard were n't in the running , indonesia would have certainly already bought a cheaper vessel somewhere else . "
hoppe referred to this as a form of " contract purchasing " for the german economy .
he vehemently objected to germany 's inclusion of such investments in its official development assistance -lrb- oda -rrb- quota , which measures how much government money is allocated for development aid .
' promises unkept ' despite such " development funds , " germany remains far from reaching its pledge of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp for developing nations , something hoppe said is not only the fault of chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government .
" every german government so far has failed in this regard , even the earlier coalition of the social democrats and the greens , " he said .
" of course , i should n't say this too loud ; but i do so anyway , because that is part of being honest .
maybe it will help get the point across that development aid should transcend party lines .
whatever happens , we have to stop making promises that we do n't keep . "
there is consensus among germany 's politicians focusing on development aid policy that merkel 's government must do more .
and this comes in the face of the current budget debate , which sees , if anything , more cuts than increases in future development spending .
civil-military cooperation one of niebel 's ideas , which is supported by his christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- coalition partners , is the idea of civil-military cooperation .
the cdu 's development spokesperson , holger haibach , argued that based on a study commissioned by niebel 's predecessor , social democrat heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , this could be the way forward . " when civilian and military action are seen as working together , the people have the impression that it is best , " haibach said .
" and since it is successful if you do it right , i believe it is right . " haibach wants to see the idea of civil-military partnership debated as part of development policy as well as " a constructive dialogue about what cooperation between the civil and military areas can contribute . " however , most ngos are opposed to the idea of working with the military out of fear they could become the targets of terrorists or hostile soldiers .

it comes as portugal announced austerity measures to bring down its budget deficit . despite frantic denials from lisbon and madrid that spain and portugal do not need eu bailout funds , investors remain nervous , pushing up borrowing costs for spanish and portuguese bonds on friday .
the eu commission also dismissed as " absolutely false " a press report that some eurozone states were pressuring lisbon to tap into the eu 's rescue funds .
a german government spokeswoman has also rejected the report .
" we are not putting on any pressure , " she said in a statement .
portugal 's parliament , meanwhile , passed its 2011 budget , which aims to reduce the country 's deficit from a projected 7.3 percent this year to 4.6 percent in 2011 .
lisbon plans to cut public sector wages , raise sales and other taxes and curb public spending .
spain has already passed its austerity budget and prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero " absolutely " ruled out tapping into eu funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers went on strike against the proposed cuts markets remain jittery those efforts not withstanding , borrowing costs rose once again for ireland , portugal and spain , as markets demand a higher premium for those countries for holding their debt .
banking shares were also hit across europe on friday , as fears persisted of contagion from ireland 's financial sector crisis .
a reuters poll this week showed that 34 out of 50 analysts expect portugal to ask for bailout funds .
the european union and the international monetary fund have set aside emergency funds worth 750 billion euros .
ireland is expected to tap into that fund to the tune of 85 billion euros , in a deal that could be agreed as early as next week .
some experts , like the governor of the bundesbank , the german central bank , believe the rescue fund needs to be topped up to 1.5 trillion .
axel weber , also a member of the european central bank , said this week that " if that -lsb- the 750 billion euros -rsb- is not enough , i 'm convinced eurozone states will do what is necessary to protect the euro . "
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , however , has dismissed his comments .
" i do n't think that 's necessary at all , " he said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2010 proposal to deport foreign criminals lands on swiss ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign criminals may soon be sent out of switzerland swiss voters decide sunday on a proposal to automatically deport foreigners who commit crimes .
the idea has gained plenty of support , but opponents say it ’ s a step to far . swiss voters are to go to the polls on sunday to decide on a proposal that would see foreigners who commit crimes become subject to automatic deportation .
supporters of the proposal , which is backed by the right-wing swiss people 's party , say that immigrants to switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime , and should not be allowed to stay in the country .
opponents however say the proposal wo n't reduce crime , but could deport many who have lived all their lives in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss are to vote on the proposal on sunday crime rates in switzerland are quite low by european standards , and some analysts suggest violent crime is actually decreasing , but it is a fact that in swiss prisons , around 70 percent of the inmates are foreign nationals , while just 23 percent of switzerland 's overall population is foreign .
crime statistics analysts caution against using these figures to score political points however , pointing out that a sizeable number of the foreigners in jail are short term illegal immigrants , awaiting deportation anyway .
critics of the proposal also point out that criminals in switzerland tend to fit the profile of criminals all over the world ; young men , on low incomes or without a job , poorly educated , and with little prospect of improving their situation .
in switzerland , however , these young men are overwhelmingly foreign - a fact opponents of deportation say should encourage the swiss government to improve integration measures and chances for foreigners , rather than crack down on crime .
hard-working foreigners wanted supporters of automatic deportation insist however that foreigners who break the law in switzerland should not have the right to stay .
“ we have in switzerland two kinds of foreigners , ” explained patrick freudiger of the swiss people 's party , “ the foreigners who want to work and respect our laws , these foreigners are welcome .
then we have other foreigners who commit crimes , who do n't want to work , they should go . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of swiss residents are immigrants as switzerland 's foreign population grows , this point of view is finding favor ; recent opinion polls show around 53 per cent of voters back the proposal .
the swiss government however has advised voters to reject it , saying automatic deportation -lrb- with no case-by-case review by a judge -rrb- could contravene switzerland 's obligations under international law .
instead the government has put forward an alternative ; a list of serious crimes which would make the perpetrator liable to deportation .
this proposal however seems to have less support so far , with many potential voters describing it as too weak , or woolly .
meanwhile opponents of both the original deportation proposal , and the government 's alternative , point to an existing swiss law allowing for the deportation of foreign criminals , any new legislation risks going too far , they say .
they point to the fact that the swiss people 's party proposal would apply even for relatively minor crimes , such as breaking and entering , drug dealing , or social security fraud .
what 's more , they claim , the law would apply to people from second and third generation immigrant families , people born in switzerland who have lived nowhere else .
anti-crime or anti-foreigner ?
what is troubling switzerland 's large foreign community most of all is the tenor of the swiss people 's party campaign in favor of deportation .
many feel targeted by the party posters depicting certain ethnic groups as guilty of certain crimes : ivan is a rapist , for example , ismir a social security cheat , and detleff a child molester .
“ you ca n't just say that everyone in switzerland who is not 100 per cent swiss tends to be criminal , ” said moreno casasola , who is half italian , half swiss , and has lived all his life in switzerland .
“ but that 's the meaning of this kind of poster , they just make a general message that all foreigners tend to be criminal , and that 's touching me as well . ”
the campaign has raised eyebrows in the international community too .
just days before the vote , the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights delivered a critical report on switzerland , expressing concern about discrimination against immigrants , and recommending that the swiss government do more to combat switzerland 's ‘ increasing intolerance and xenophobia . ”
likely to pass in fact , political analysts suggest this vote has far more to do with exploiting fears , in particular worries about globalization and immigration , than it has to with crime .
“ this vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners ” said georg lutz , political science professor at the university of lausanne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a minaret ban passed last year in switzerland “ what most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners , and that is the central motivation . ”
if the latest opinion polls are correct , swiss voters will say yes to the deportation proposal on sunday .
if they do , switzerland will have some of the strictest deportation laws in europe , international law experts argue they may even violate the european convention on human rights .
this , however , is unlikely to trouble the swiss people 's party , which successfully masterminded the campaign to ban minarets last year , a decision which raised serious questions about switzerland 's commitment to allowing freedom of religious expression .

bayer leverkusen , however , are happy to stay out of the headlines and get on with winning soccer matches . it 's easy to forget that biggest story of last season first half was a juggernaut in the form of bayer leverkusen .
the chemical firm ’ s company team topped the league for 15 straight weeks , and went unbeaten for the first 25 games .
it didn ’ t last , however - bayer imploded , losing five of the last ten matches and finishing out of the champions league spots .
bayern munich romped to the title , the german cup and a champions league runners-up place , but leverkusen ’ s fall from grace was nearly as enthralling a tale .
history is always most favorable to the victor so perhaps it was no surprise that leverkusen 's implosion was eclipsed by bayern 's success .
leverkusen were probably happy this was the case .
they seemed uncomfortable in the spotlight even as they were setting the pace , so when their inadequacies were finally exposed , it must have come as bittersweet relief for the focus to shift to someone else , even if it meant that they would remain saddled with the " neverkusen " tag .
that one is destined to remain until the club captures a bundesliga title .
while their slide to fourth must have hurt , the redirecting of the media glare to other clubs more used to the attention appears to have done leverkusen good .
with the cameras trained elsewhere , they can work on digesting last season ’ s bitter pill quietly .
leverkusen hiding in the pack , waiting to pounce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen know well what can happen to quick-rising teams it appears from their form and their demeanor so far this season that last year 's swoon is unlikely to be repeated .
leverkusen have approached this bundesliga campaign in the same way a sprint finisher may approach a long , winding stage of the tour de france .
instead of racing ahead with the hope that they have legs enough to hold off their challengers over the final miles , leverkusen are keeping pace with the leaders under the cover of the following peloton .
everyone knows they 're there but the focus is out in front - and that 's just how leverkusen like it .
ahead of saturday 's game away to fellow chasing-packers hoffenheim , leverkusen 's task still looks daunting .
they are nine points behind table-topping borussia dortmund , dropping from second to third after drawing with bayern last weekend .
still they look now like a team in better shape to challenge for the title than the one which was top of the league going into match day 14 last season .
it may sound like a strange conclusion to draw considering leverkusen were unbeaten at the same stage last season , and were three points clear at the top .
but their current condition is less about statistics and points .
it has much more to do with countenance , commitment and the fine art of keeping their mouths shut .
topsy-turvy league allows bayer to remain consistent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with top teams floundering , leverkusen remain consistent after the inflated expectations of last season , leverkusen are happy punching at their exact weight .
with everyone else either underperforming -lrb- bayern , bremen , schalke -rrb- or exceeding -lrb- mainz , freiburg , hanover - even dortmund -rrb- , leverkusen are playing at a consistent level , safe in the personally acquired knowledge that everything can come crashing down for those high-flying clubs that suddenly find themselves out of fuel in the final weeks of a title race .
perhaps it 's the old chestnut of german soccer fans that leverkusen will be perennial nearly-men for as long as the ball is round , but scant notice has been taken of their stealthy pursuit of the early pacesetters .
whatever is allowing leverkusen to slip under the radar , the team is happy to let them believe what they want and not draw any undue attention to their progress .
in this case , maybe the injury and absence of michael ballack has helped leverkusen 's cause in more ways than his presence on the pitch ever could .
with the germany captain in their ranks , leverkusen become a media magnet again .
with ballack sidelined with a long-term ankle injury , the team can get on with things with the minimum of fuss .
much to shout about but heynckes enforces code of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes : no comment besides , why lament the loss of ballack when the team has renato augusto , a classic no. 10 ?
the 22-year-old brazilian has been pulling the strings in the manner of a player with ten years more experience but with twice the energy .
then there 's arturo vidal , the chilean midfielder who is enjoying a breakout season in which he breaks into the rank of the league ’ s elite defensive midfielders – and who is the team 's top scorer at the moment with five goals , to boot .
just behind him in the scoring stakes -lrb- on four -rrb- is sidney sam , a 22-year-old wing forward whose speed is making a mug of full-backs across germany .
should leverkusen choose to blow their own trumpet they could also draw attention to the return to fitness and form of goalkeeper rene adler as a reason for their solidity .
after conceding six against borussia moenchengladbach in their second match , adler and his defensive team have been efficiently parsimonious , conceding on average a goal a game .
however , no-one at leverkusen is shouting about any of that .
leverkusen can not be blamed for adopting a form of omerta , the mafia 's code of silence , after the painful experience of last season .
coach jupp heynckes knows that for his players to concentrate on the business of winning soccer matches expectations must be tempered and praise must be restricted to private moments .
after all , a sprint finisher ca n't make his surprise break for the tape if he 's busy ringing his own bell , can he ?

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .
in 2002 , pool re removed exclusion clauses for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks .
the need for terrorism insurance has become more apparent since the sept .
11 attacks , which also damaged beyond repair the deutsche bank building adjacent to the world trade center .
deutsche bank later found itself in a legal dispute with the allianz and axa insurance companies , which disputed the status of the building as a total loss .
some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .

in the wake of the democrats ' midterm election losses , it 's unlikely that the us will seize the initiative in cancun . a day after the democrats ' defeat in congressional elections this november , president barack obama acknowledged that it would be hard to push a climate treaty through congress .
most of the newly elected republican senators and representatives either deny climate change or they contest its dangers .
even a few democrats are sceptical about it .
they 're afraid of the negative ramifications a treaty might have on the economy due to higher energy prices and rising unemployment .
looking for new means bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environmental protection agency may be obama 's last best hope obama , who made climate policy a top issue of his presidential campaign , has indicated that progress remains possible , despite the disastrous outcome of this year 's midterm elections for his party .
" carbon trade was just one way of skinning the cat .
it was not the only way .
and i 'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem . "
he 'll need to , if he wants to keep the promise he made during at last year 's summit in copenhagen : to reduce the united states ' carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade .
at least one option is open to the president .
the us environmental authority epa classified carbon dioxide as a public threat to health , and has introduced regulations for the emissions of cars and factories .
the first guidelines will take effect next year .
republicans will try to stop the guidelines from being implemented , but even if they pass an opposing bill in congress , the president would need to sign it into law .
that 's not going to happen , says todd stern , us special envoy for climate change : " the president has made clear , and we have made clear , that the united states is standing behind the pledge that we made last year .
there 's no change in that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senator john kerry failed to get republicans to support an energy bill this year compromise with republicans ?
president obama hopes to compromise with republicans on a series of smaller climate policy issues .
nick loris , energy expert for the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank , says this may yet be possible .
" there are policies that we would n't support but i think they can get done .
i mean even if you look at president bush 's administration – there were two energy bills in 2005 and 2007 that conservatives and proponents of the free market opposed but republicans got behind , " loris said . like many conservatives in the us , loris is not fond of such bills .
he says energy generation should be left to a free market .
however , a number of republicans support tax breaks for wind , solar , and nuclear energy , as well as higher energy efficiency standards .
despite this , the comprehensive energy bill that passed the house of representatives was never even debated in the senate .
this has left individual states in the us to take the lead .
some states , for example california , have already passed strict waste gas regulations .
california , the world 's eighth largest economy , has also proposed a law for trading emissions fashioned upon the european model .
it aims to provide a market-based solution for encouraging companies to embrace cleaner technologies and higher energy efficiency standards .
obama 's climate envoy , todd stern , recently acknowledged that california has always played a pioneering role in environmental policy .
he also said that he was very relieved to hear that the effort to derail california 's carbon trade bill was defeated in a referendum during the midterm elections .
hoping for the president 's leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick loris says obama may be able to compromise with republicans on some issues so other than the efforts of individual states , the us delegation will arrive at cancun with empty hands .
according to greenpeace climate expert kyle ash , the us government 's strategy prior to the midterm elections was to prolong international negotiations until a us climate treaty was passed .
if obama holds on to this strategy , this could mean another three years of climate stalemate – until the next presidential elections .
yet kyle ash also sees another possibility .
" obama has the legal authority to commit the us to strong targets and to come to agreement on all of the issues in cancun , " he said .
obama could even make financial commitments , since long-term investments do n't have to be passed in their entirety by the current congress .
but ash also says one would have to be particularly optimistic about these prospects given the current political and economic climate .
despite this , the greenpeace expert hopes that obama will seize the initiative after his recent loss in the midterm elections .
" if there 's one issue that 's super important , that affects not just foreign policy but domestic policy in a big way - that 's climate change . "

recent terror warnings have spiked demand . rising fear of terror attacks in germany is apparently spurring sales of insurance policies covering terror damages .
extremus , the country 's only insurer offering such policies , says it is experiencing increased demand .
based in cologne , extremus is a government-backed group of 16 insurers .
it was founded after the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in new york and washington , covering losses above 25 million euros .
extremus executive dirk harbrucker says the company is in its yearly cycle of renewing policies and has n't had time to crunch the numbers yet .
but there is " definite demand in a capacity , which we have n't experienced before , " he told deutsche welle .
although the company got off to a lagging start in 2002 , it fills a market gap left open after other insurance companies backed out .
a large portion of extremus ' policies apply to real estate , according to harbrucker .
terror insurance , he explained , makes possible the financing of expensive properties and the establishment of real estate investment funds .
while terrorism damages up to 25 million euros are generally covered by conventional insurance policies , that 's nowhere near enough to insure an airport , a skyscraper or an industrial facility , according to harbrucker .
all german airports are insured by extremus .
" if the properties are financed , then there is often pressure from the banks that all risks be covered , " he said .
" it used to be that one could just say , ' well , okay , terror is an abstract threat .
it could happen , but thus far we have n't had it happen in germany . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without terror insurance , investment into expensive projects could lag slow growth operating in a niche market , extremus has been slow to grow over the years , with 1,176 policies in 2004 .
business today is slightly up , to 1,327 policies insuring 7,000 objects , some of which are bundles of multiple assets .
the company only insures assets in germany , where its government guarantee is valid .
pool re , a british counterpart to extremus , was founded in 1993 and has since incurred a total of 611 million pounds -lrb- 724 million euros -rrb- in losses .
in 2002 , pool re removed exclusion clauses for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear attacks .
the need for terrorism insurance has become more apparent since the sept .
11 attacks , which also damaged beyond repair the deutsche bank building adjacent to the world trade center .
deutsche bank later found itself in a legal dispute with the allianz and axa insurance companies , which disputed the status of the building as a total loss .
some branches more exposed katrin ruter de escobar , of the german insurance association in berlin , says extremus fills a vital role in creating a degree of certainty and encouraging investment into large projects .
" naturally , there are different risks associated with various -lrb- industry -rrb- branches and companies , " she told deutsche welle .
" companies that could be perceived as a symbol of the social order here have a higher risk of terror attacks .
so for certain branches , it certainly makes sense .
there are more exposed branches and less exposed branches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bank building by the world trade center was damaged in 2001 recent warnings by the german government about a concrete terror plot against the country have spurred interest in the policies offered by extremus .
but given the conditions of the policies , the possibility for the company 's market expansion remains limited .
heike trilovszky of munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurance companies , recently said that interest in terror insurance remains low .
" apparently many are saying to themselves , ' i have more significant problems , and if something happens then someone will step up , possibly the government , " ' he told the german newspaper die welt .
but trilovszky warned against closing extremus due to low demand .
" the private insurance industry ca n't repeat the mistakes made before 2001 and cover damages from terrorism itself , " he said .
