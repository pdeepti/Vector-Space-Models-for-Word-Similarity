program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 25.06.2010 german court rules in favor of passive assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say legislation on assisted suicide in germany is unclear germany 's federal court of justice has ruled that assisted suicide is legal in certain cases .
the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 25.06.2010 kyrgyzstan to vote in controversial referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks , who fled the unrest in southern kyrgyzstan , are slowly returning despite simmering tensions due to recent ethnic violence , voters in kyrgyzstan are being asked to go to the polls this sunday in a referendum over a new constitution . although thousands of people were affected by bloody clashes two weeks ago between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in the south of the country , kyrgyzstan 's interim government has insisted that a referendum on a new constitution take place .
a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 merkel concedes defeat on bank levy at g-8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has failed to get non-europeans on board german chancellor angela merkel admitted that she had failed to convince other leaders at the g-8 summit to adopt a global bank tax .
but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !

groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid .

" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .

though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .

spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .
together , the g-20 nations make up two-thirds of the world population and represent about 85 percent of global economic power . author : joanna impey , richard connor , holly fox -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer , kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid .

to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .

living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .

" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 25.06.2010 italians protest berlusconi 's austerity plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi insists the cuts are vital for italy 's future italian workers walked out in a protest against austerity cuts , disrupting transport services across the country .
italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 opinion : fifa world cup 2010 - why the south africans should get the cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african fans are celebrating the positive image projected through the world cup will benefit south africa and the whole continent , but it remains to be seen whether it will improve the lives of poor south africans , argues christian von drachenfels . admittedly , the south african national team 's chances of winning the world cup were limited from the start .
however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 opinion : fifa world cup 2010 - why the south africans should get the cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african fans are celebrating the positive image projected through the world cup will benefit south africa and the whole continent , but it remains to be seen whether it will improve the lives of poor south africans , argues christian von drachenfels . admittedly , the south african national team 's chances of winning the world cup were limited from the start .
however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 25.06.2010 spain need to beat bouts of self-doubt as well as chile to progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's world cup participation is currently up in the air it seems ridiculous to consider that spain may be flying home from the world cup this weekend .
few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

dw-world.de in joint letter , merkel and sarkozy urge eu naked short selling ban in a show of unity , germany and france have written the european commission urging it to speed up the process of financial market regulation and calling for the adoption of a ban on naked short selling .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .
together , the g-20 nations make up two-thirds of the world population and represent about 85 percent of global economic power . author : joanna impey , richard connor , holly fox -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer , kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.06.2010 not just for laughs : english comedy is essential comfort blanket in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anglophone comedy is now a bona fide " scene " in berlin , thanks mainly to a bar called sin .
driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- . " but however obvious or obscure these jokes are , however stupid or sophisticated , the main point is that you need them , and your audience needs them .
they define the english comedy " scene . "
they have become what binds anglophones together after a hard day of trying not to be treated like a tourist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .
together , the g-20 nations make up two-thirds of the world population and represent about 85 percent of global economic power . author : joanna impey , richard connor , holly fox -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer , kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .

the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .

nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .

" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .

furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .

the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .

" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .

it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .

" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits .

europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .

but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .
together , the g-20 nations make up two-thirds of the world population and represent about 85 percent of global economic power . author : joanna impey , richard connor , holly fox -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : andreas illmer , kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- . " but however obvious or obscure these jokes are , however stupid or sophisticated , the main point is that you need them , and your audience needs them .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .

everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-

but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .

no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .

this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.06.2010 google feud spotlights internet censorship in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has censored google in the past - and now turkey is following suit good luck using google in turkey - the service is blocked or operates at a snail 's pace due to a clash between the governement and the search engine .
turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- . " but however obvious or obscure these jokes are , however stupid or sophisticated , the main point is that you need them , and your audience needs them .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .

chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .

honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .

honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 opinion : fifa world cup 2010 - why the south africans should get the cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african fans are celebrating the positive image projected through the world cup will benefit south africa and the whole continent , but it remains to be seen whether it will improve the lives of poor south africans , argues christian von drachenfels . admittedly , the south african national team 's chances of winning the world cup were limited from the start .
however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 g-8 and g-20 leaders on course to disagree großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel hopes to show president obama the path to recovery leaders attending the g-8 and g-20 meetings in canada will debate – and inevitably disagree – on several issues impacting the global economy .
germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 25.06.2010 spain need to beat bouts of self-doubt as well as chile to progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's world cup participation is currently up in the air it seems ridiculous to consider that spain may be flying home from the world cup this weekend .
few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 opinion : fifa world cup 2010 - why the south africans should get the cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african fans are celebrating the positive image projected through the world cup will benefit south africa and the whole continent , but it remains to be seen whether it will improve the lives of poor south africans , argues christian von drachenfels . admittedly , the south african national team 's chances of winning the world cup were limited from the start .
however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .

except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .

this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- .

few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.06.2010 google feud spotlights internet censorship in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has censored google in the past - and now turkey is following suit good luck using google in turkey - the service is blocked or operates at a snail 's pace due to a clash between the governement and the search engine .
turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .

he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .

it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 25.06.2010 spain need to beat bouts of self-doubt as well as chile to progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's world cup participation is currently up in the air it seems ridiculous to consider that spain may be flying home from the world cup this weekend .
few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

germany 's austerity program and its ban on naked short selling are among them . maneuvering by some member nations on key economic issues ahead of the global summits have many economic and financial experts wondering about the outcome of the talks .
last week , us president barack obama called on member countries to avoid weakening the global economic recovery by focusing too much on debt reduction .
that plea was firmly rejected on thursday by the nation that prompted the president 's response in the first place : germany .
defusing the deficit in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on thursday , chancellor angela merkel said the government would stick to its austerity program .
she pointed to a federal deficit of 80 billion euros this year in a budget totaling 320 billion euros , emphasizing an urgency to reduce the deficit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany seeks greater regulation of financial markets merkel added that she had told obama in a phone call that the german government has done much to support economic growth with stimulus measures .
the chancellor said that she had made clear to the president that " germany will do much more for the recovery of the world economy in 2010 than -lrb- other countries -rrb- on average . "
financial experts say germany 's focus on deficit reduction instead of spending is one of several issues that could divide summit members .
germany is a member of the g-8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the group of the world 's wealthiest nations , with the us , canada , britain , france , italy , russia and japan .
the g-8 summit precedes the g-20 -lrb- group of 20 -rrb- .
the group covers 20 economies , which consists of 19 countries and the european union .
collectively , it accounts for 85 percent of the global production and more than 80 percent of world trade : roiled international partners besides its austerity program , germany has also led the charge on banning " naked " short sales to slow speculators who bet on european governments defaulting on their loans .
a naked short sale is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether and is thus viewed as far riskier form of trading .
bildunterschrift : banks in germany are n't happy about discussed financial crisis fund the move has stunned germany 's international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide .
germany is also a member of a group , including france and the united kingdom , which is pushing for a new bank charge to help meet costs of dealing with financial crisis .
this issue , together with the austerity program and naked short selling ban , has led to some tension among g-20 members ahead of the summit .
all three are areas are likely to result in plenty of disagreement as leaders debate steps to prevent a repeat of the global financial and economic crisis .
german isolation some observers believe berlin could find itself isolated among many of the g-20 members and fail to win support for key measures it seeks , such as greater regulation of financial markets .
the high-level meetings in canada will also likely include discussion of how china intends to implement its currency adjustment plan , of how the g-20 should respond to global crisis spots and what international sanctions it should maintain or add against iran .
the gulf of mexico oil spill is also a possible discussion point , underscoring a need to shift resources into energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
however , the environmental group greenpeace claims it has obtained a draft g-20 statement that essentially reverses last year 's commitment to " phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . "
the draft includes new wording such as " voluntary , member-specific approaches . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 25.06.2010 spain need to beat bouts of self-doubt as well as chile to progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's world cup participation is currently up in the air it seems ridiculous to consider that spain may be flying home from the world cup this weekend .
few would have dared consider the european champions leaving the tournament so early before the world cup began . heading into this world cup , many had tipped spain to add a world title to the european one they so magnificently won in switzerland and austria two years ago .
but if their ebbing self-confidence , dogged as it is by the ghosts of past failures , combine with results beyond their control , the spanish could be eliminated by the end of play on friday night .
spain need to beat chile to go through as group h winners , or draw - if switzerland lose or draw - to progress as runners-up .
should the spanish get beaten by chile , however , with switzerland scoring at least a point against honduras , then spain could be on their way home .
their progress to the next round is far from assured and with chile unlikely to ease up on the gas , spain will need their big game players like fernando torres , david villa and xavi hernandez to be on song .
herein lies spain 's problem .
this is a team built to attack and to rip teams to shreds .
from the back to the front , spain have players who should be pushing teams to their own goal line while peppering nervous goalkeepers shots from all over the park .
few teams have defenders like gerard pique , sergio ramos and david capdevila , who have serious skill on the ball and can join the attack to threaten the goal .
even without the injury-nagged andres iniesta pulling the strings , spain have a wealth of creative players in midfield .
xavi , jesus navas and david silva have been turning opposing midfields inside-out - and , amazingly , keeping the likes of cesc fabregas out of the first team .
up front , few sides can count on a duo as deadly on their day as david villa and fernando torres .
spanish artists too fearful to win and yet spain have just two goals to their name so far in the tournament - both from villa , and both against honduras .
both goals had more than a little slice of luck about them and on balance , spain has wasted many more chances than not in the tournament .
spain get themselves in scoring positions as often as other teams get throw-ins .
the problem at this world cup is that no-one has taken the opportunities when presented with them .
spain are playing like a team afraid to lose .
bildunterschrift : villa may have scored spain 's two goals but he could have had a more had he been more composed their passing game is a joy to watch - when it results in an incisive through ball or powerful shot .
it becomes sleep-inducing when it goes from one side of the penalty area to the other for over ten minutes with no-one willing to have a punt at goal .
this is a team in stark contrast to the one which blew the rest of europe away in 2008 .
against both honduras and switzerland the furia roja often reverted to the frustrating spain of old - with possession in the final third coming not to the climax of a lashing shot on goal , but remaining mired in a series of lame lay-offs by players who look positively allergic to putting an opposing keeper to the test .
-lrb- this means you , especially , xavi . -rrb-
maybe the expectation which comes with being european champions is too heavy for them to bear .
no-one has been slated for saying spain could win the cup , such is the belief that this is a team capable of doing so .
maybe these people are crazy - given the weight of historical precedence of spain choking at world cups .
this is by far their best-ever chance .
more mediocre spanish squads have arrived with huge expectations and have wilted .
this team actually has the tools to win - but refuses to believe it .
group h knife-edge has spain sweating spain need to start believing - and fast .
chile are no slouches .
the south american qualifying runners-up have looked impressive so far and have yet to drop a point .
the south americans were not much fancied coming into the finals but few will be discounting them now .
whether they progress from group h in the top spot remains to be seen , but they currently sit at the summit above spain with six points to spain 's three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few should underestimate the swiss after they beat spain switzerland , on three points in third place due to inferior goal difference to spain , need to beat honduras and hope that spain draw or lose to chile to make the last 16 .
ottmar hitzfeld 's team pulled off one of the surprises of the tournament by beating spain in the opening group game and they were unlucky to lose 1-0 to chile in their second .
honduras , for their part , have yet to score a goal at this world cup but have not been blown off the park either .
they are an offensively-minded team and switzerland will have to be vigilant in defense - and get themselves a goal at the other end to make it to the next round .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

driven by desperate attempts to fit in , and jokes about shelf toilets , insecure anglo-saxons have finally found a bolt-hole . it was bound to happen .
there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- . " but however obvious or obscure these jokes are , however stupid or sophisticated , the main point is that you need them , and your audience needs them .

there were so many sexually desperate english speakers hanging around in berlin , lacking motivation to learn german -lrb- because most germans would rather miss a grill party than an opportunity to practice their english -rrb- , that it was only a matter of time before enough of them coalesced in a small bar and turned it into a comedy club - at least once a month . that bar is called sin , and the night is comedy in sin .
there were other english comedy nights in berlin before - but they always took place on foreign ground , one way or another .
either they happened as a token sunday-night experiment in places like the kookaburra , a wood-panelled german comedy establishment that peddles the refined wit of sketch-shows , or they were one-off performances in the english theater berlin .
theaters are no good for comedians - comedians need the smell of spilled beer , the comfort of alcohol , and the remote chance of sex that only a bar provides . so comedy in sin is where something resembling " a scene " was first born about a year ago .
a scene usually means more than one night in one bar , but it is a successful night -lrb- the dilapidated sofas are severely tested -rrb- in exactly the right kind of bar - small , dark , financially unstable , and run by a middle-aged american rock musician .
you get a lot for your three euros entry - some whisky , for a start , and about 10 acts ranging from beginners to slight geniuses , with a lot of patchy in-between states of tarnished brilliance , artistic ambition , insecurity , vanity , anger and misplaced talent .
every psychological flaw gets a chance . a leisurely rat-race if you think you 're funny , this is where you find out .
except you do n't , because the audience - a balanced mix of english speakers and germans - is very friendly , and your peers , also grateful to have found a place they belong , are not critical enough .
everyone knows each other too well - the " scene , " if that 's what this collection of lonely souls amounts to , is still in a vulnerable new-born phase . sin 's regular co-founder and host paul salamone once articulated the problem perfectly in his blog : " it 's hard to tell your friends when they suck without stinking up the room , and yet that 's the only way a scene can progress in lieu of a larger comedy milieu . -lrb- ... -rrb-
nevertheless , these statements need to be made .
gingerly . " " let 's face it , " the prolific and ambitious paul admitted , " real english-speaking comedians will probably need to eventually work in london , new york , or la -lrb- or if they do improv , chicago -rrb- if they ever hope to succeed . "
but berlin is a slower rat-race , where the rats do n't mind sitting in their jogging pants all day , cheerily encouraging each other 's hopeless artistic ambitions . but all these english-speaking berlin comics , as comfortable as they might seem , still have a fire in them that compels them to wrestle their demons on stage .
and that fire is fueled by germany .
it turns out that being an insecure anglo-saxon embedded in german culture is a seam of comedy gold that reaches deep . shelf toilets , traffic lights and nudism the jokes about germany are almost readymade ; like dadaist objects , they are right there on the streets .
take pedestrian crossings , for example .
no german-based english comic has not mastered a routine about how germans obey the red man and the green man too much .
then there are " shelf , " or " landing pad " toilets - the mysterious teutonic insistence on keeping poo dry for a moment longer leads to infinite hilarious speculations .
ditto the german affection for nudist culture .
all these jokes tap into the received understanding of the german national character - and it helps that laughing at germans is a well-honed anglo-american tradition since - well - since the war .
there , i mentioned it . but , as paul said , " those jokes are like training wheels - everyone uses them in the beginning to get some cheap laughs and confidence up , but then the goal is either a -rrb- to start approaching those hackneyed topics in a very creative way , or b -rrb- to find weirder , more obscure stuff to talk about .
this is hard , because everyone in the audience knows about the traffic lights , the nudity , and world war ii , but not a lot know that , for instance , wilhelm ii had a withered arm or that the round poles everyone puts their posters on are called dicke damen -lsb- " fat ladies " -rsb- . " but however obvious or obscure these jokes are , however stupid or sophisticated , the main point is that you need them , and your audience needs them .
they define the english comedy " scene . "
they have become what binds anglophones together after a hard day of trying not to be treated like a tourist .
no , damn it , we actually live here !
we really like it ! ben knight has performed at sin , the kookaburra , and english theater berlin .
he hopes he 's got it out of his system now . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 merkel concedes defeat on bank levy at g-8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has failed to get non-europeans on board german chancellor angela merkel admitted that she had failed to convince other leaders at the g-8 summit to adopt a global bank tax .
but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .

cultural exchange is the name of the game , and mutual understanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 911 attacks on the world trade center in new york plunged the world into crisis the change is also a result of the transformations that the world has gone through since the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , as well as the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 .
pushpanathan sundram , the deputy secretary general of asean , thinks mutual understanding is of utmost importance in the light of the global situation and the fact that countries are becoming increasingly interdependent economically .
" if you open up your mind , open up your soul , then you will be able to understand one another .
because if we do n't understand one another , then you have what you call a clash of cultures , " he explains .
" the west can learn from asean " the politician , who is from singapore , thinks that the western world could learn from asean , especially with regard to china and the question of human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association of south east asian nations has good relations with china " asean 's relation with china is fantastic - it is very good because we learn from each other , we see ourselves as equal partners , and if there is a disagreement we accept it and we look forward to looking at how to resolve it .

that 's the way to go forward , " he says .

" in china , we really take urbanization and migration as key elements because no matter whether or not you like it , people 's movement , free movement , has become the trend .
we see this as positive but it is also a great challenge for the government and society . "
clashes over how to define human rights despite an apparent readiness to embrace the other and to promote cultural exchange , sticking points remain - especially with regard to human rights .
china and the west have often clashed in the past over their definition .
however , sweden 's former development minister , jan karlsson , believes there is cause for hope .
" as a european , you sometimes come to a situation where you say ' this is not human rights ' .
we come to a line where we have to ask how we see the values laid down in the protocol for human rights .
thank goodness , mankind has invented a universal organisation and has a protocol of human rights .
we stand on reasonably fixed ground that this is something all mankind has to abide . "
most governments would agree with this attitude in theory but few are ready to give up their sovereignty in deciding certain matters that they think pertain to their national interest only .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.06.2010 poverty a growing issue even in wealthy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's definition of poverty differs from other countries ' the eu has declared 2010 the european year for combating poverty and exclusion , yet recent studies suggest that germany 's poor and middle class are getting poorer . a thick red line in front of berlin 's brandenburg gate marks a symbolic barrier where there once stood a 12-foot wall of reinforced concrete .
behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.06.2010 europe worries over raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vast china is rich in numerous critical raw materials europe could face a severe shortage of raw materials needed for emerging technologies such as thin-film solar photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries , according to the european commission . the european commission has pushed the alarm button on raw materials after an expert group listed 14 materials facing a " critical " risk of shortage , some within a few years .
in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

cultural exchange is the name of the game , and mutual understanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 911 attacks on the world trade center in new york plunged the world into crisis the change is also a result of the transformations that the world has gone through since the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , as well as the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 .
pushpanathan sundram , the deputy secretary general of asean , thinks mutual understanding is of utmost importance in the light of the global situation and the fact that countries are becoming increasingly interdependent economically .
" if you open up your mind , open up your soul , then you will be able to understand one another .
because if we do n't understand one another , then you have what you call a clash of cultures , " he explains .
" the west can learn from asean " the politician , who is from singapore , thinks that the western world could learn from asean , especially with regard to china and the question of human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association of south east asian nations has good relations with china " asean 's relation with china is fantastic - it is very good because we learn from each other , we see ourselves as equal partners , and if there is a disagreement we accept it and we look forward to looking at how to resolve it .
" so i think there needs to be a two-way channel for learning each other 's culture and how to appreciate and tolerate one another 's culture .
that 's the way to go forward , " he says .
migration poses a challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are millions of migrant workers in china meanwhile , in the globalized world , where there is a constant flux of migration , baige zhao , china 's vice minister for population and family planning , thinks that countries can learn about mutual understanding from the way china deals with its population of migrant workers .
" in china , we really take urbanization and migration as key elements because no matter whether or not you like it , people 's movement , free movement , has become the trend .
we see this as positive but it is also a great challenge for the government and society . "
clashes over how to define human rights despite an apparent readiness to embrace the other and to promote cultural exchange , sticking points remain - especially with regard to human rights .
china and the west have often clashed in the past over their definition .
however , sweden 's former development minister , jan karlsson , believes there is cause for hope .
" as a european , you sometimes come to a situation where you say ' this is not human rights ' .
we come to a line where we have to ask how we see the values laid down in the protocol for human rights .
thank goodness , mankind has invented a universal organisation and has a protocol of human rights .
we stand on reasonably fixed ground that this is something all mankind has to abide . "
most governments would agree with this attitude in theory but few are ready to give up their sovereignty in deciding certain matters that they think pertain to their national interest only .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 25.06.2010 from aid to cooperation : the changing face of development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural understanding is becoming a key element of development work in recent years , development and aid agencies have understood that projects can only be successful if the values and culture of those on the receiving end are taken into account . it used to be called simply development aid but now talk among those who want to promote economic , social and environmental development is of cooperation .
cultural exchange is the name of the game , and mutual understanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 911 attacks on the world trade center in new york plunged the world into crisis the change is also a result of the transformations that the world has gone through since the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , as well as the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 .
pushpanathan sundram , the deputy secretary general of asean , thinks mutual understanding is of utmost importance in the light of the global situation and the fact that countries are becoming increasingly interdependent economically .
" if you open up your mind , open up your soul , then you will be able to understand one another .
because if we do n't understand one another , then you have what you call a clash of cultures , " he explains .
" the west can learn from asean " the politician , who is from singapore , thinks that the western world could learn from asean , especially with regard to china and the question of human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association of south east asian nations has good relations with china " asean 's relation with china is fantastic - it is very good because we learn from each other , we see ourselves as equal partners , and if there is a disagreement we accept it and we look forward to looking at how to resolve it .
" so i think there needs to be a two-way channel for learning each other 's culture and how to appreciate and tolerate one another 's culture .
that 's the way to go forward , " he says .
migration poses a challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are millions of migrant workers in china meanwhile , in the globalized world , where there is a constant flux of migration , baige zhao , china 's vice minister for population and family planning , thinks that countries can learn about mutual understanding from the way china deals with its population of migrant workers .
" in china , we really take urbanization and migration as key elements because no matter whether or not you like it , people 's movement , free movement , has become the trend .
we see this as positive but it is also a great challenge for the government and society . "
clashes over how to define human rights despite an apparent readiness to embrace the other and to promote cultural exchange , sticking points remain - especially with regard to human rights .
china and the west have often clashed in the past over their definition .
however , sweden 's former development minister , jan karlsson , believes there is cause for hope .
" as a european , you sometimes come to a situation where you say ' this is not human rights ' .
we come to a line where we have to ask how we see the values laid down in the protocol for human rights .
thank goodness , mankind has invented a universal organisation and has a protocol of human rights .
we stand on reasonably fixed ground that this is something all mankind has to abide . "
most governments would agree with this attitude in theory but few are ready to give up their sovereignty in deciding certain matters that they think pertain to their national interest only .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .

" i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits .

british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 25.06.2010 kyrgyzstan to vote in controversial referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks , who fled the unrest in southern kyrgyzstan , are slowly returning despite simmering tensions due to recent ethnic violence , voters in kyrgyzstan are being asked to go to the polls this sunday in a referendum over a new constitution . although thousands of people were affected by bloody clashes two weeks ago between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in the south of the country , kyrgyzstan 's interim government has insisted that a referendum on a new constitution take place .
a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .
in the past , google has been reluctant to set up a presence in turkey because analysts say that would mean opening itself up to prosecution over the content shown on its site .
youtube blocked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president abdullah gul has said internet bans do n't belong in turkey google 's hugely popular youtube video-sharing site has already been banned for 2 years in turkey because of the presence of videos denigrating ataturk , the founder of modern turkey .
courts are still handing out long jail sentences to journalists under the country 's anti-terror and anti-defamation laws .
professor of media studies at istanbul bilgi university haluk sahin says turkey 's lawmakers are simply unable to move with the times .
" it 's an extension of a mentality that has very deep roots here .
we do n't have a liberal tradition in which freedom of speech and expression is considered to be of a fundamental part of civilized life , " said shain .
as a result , said shain , lawmakers react to developments the same way their fathers and grandfathers did - with bans .
embarrassing censorship thousands of web pages have been banned by turkish courts , under an anti-pornography law .
many savvy web users are circumventing the bans by using proxy servers , but the courts hit back this week by outlawing them .
president abdullah gul has spoken out against the bans .
" of course there should not be such bans in turkey , " he said .
" if there is a need for a new law , then the law should be introduced , " gul said .
he added that turkey should n't be seen as a country which bans websites .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet censorship could cast doubt on turkey 's bid for eu candidacy but transport minister binali yıldırım expressed a different view .
" we are not in a position to bargain with them .
they need to accept turkish laws and have a valid address in turkey , " yıldırım said , refering to googles tactic of rerouting searches to places outside of turkey 's jurisdiction .
european criticism in a report this week the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a conflict prevention organization , strongly criticized the censorship .
the european union , which turkey aspires to join , has also voiced concern .
british labor party deputy richard howitt , who is also the vice president of the european parliament 's human rights sub-committee , criticized the ban .
" these complaints which we brought to our parliamentary colleagues were listened to and we got commitments for them to be investigated , " said howitt .
but professor sahin doesn ’ t share his optimism .
he says despite the growing national and international pressure , changes to legislation can not be expected anytime soon .
" nobody seems to move a finger to change them , even when they say the see -lrb- the problem -rrb- , they do not take necessary steps to get rid of them .
it 's anomaly that makes turkey an embarrassing place , " sahin said .
with no internet reforms on the agenda , such pessimism would appear justified .
turkey seems destined to remain - at least for a time - in the company of countries like burma , north korea and iran , where internet freedom is not a given .

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.06.2010 merkel concedes defeat on bank levy at g-8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has failed to get non-europeans on board german chancellor angela merkel admitted that she had failed to convince other leaders at the g-8 summit to adopt a global bank tax .
but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .

" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .
according to critics , measures such as pay freezes will thwart demand for products from other struggling european economies . bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister david cameron is making his global debut at the summit hosts canada back the us canadian prime minister stephen harper said in a letter last week to g-20 leaders that major western countries must " send a clear message " about their long-term plans to sharply reduce deficits . but he also warned of lurking danger .
" the fiscal stimulus we have implemented was necessary to protect our economies from a much worse crisis , " he wrote . merkel arrived in canada on friday , and flew to huntsville , the resort where the summit opened at midday local time .
the topics up for discussion aside from economic policy include the middle east and the conflict surrounding iran 's nuclear program as well as afghanistan . the economic debate is likely to come to a head on saturday and sunday , when an additional 11 countries will join the talks , plus the european union , as the g-8 turns into the g-20 summit .

but she dismissed talk of a rift with the us over european austerity measures . before heading to canada to meet with leaders of the world 's top economies , german chancellor angela merkel had hoped to get an agreement on a worldwide tax on bank risk-taking and a tax on financial transactions , but she has conceded that neither g-8 nor g-20 countries were likely to endorse the plan . " i think that we europeans have a more positive approach -lrb- to the tax issue -rrb- ... but other countries will not join in , " merkel said on friday after the first day of talks at the g-8 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders want banks to pay for their share of the crisis leaders of the european union agreed on june 17 to call on the g-20 group of advanced and emerging economies to enact both measures to discourage risk-taking by banks and force banks to pay for bank failures .
sweden has already imposed a levy on its banks and britain , france and germany have all agreed to do the same . but summit host canada came out against the plans , partly because canadian banks have emerged relatively unscathed from the economic crisis .
other participants see the taxes as a poorly timed intervention as banks and economies focus on recovering from the economic meltdown . " in most states , the problem is that the banking sector has not reached pre-crisis levels of lending to the real economy .
the introduction of such taxes and levies would hardly be a factor to stimulate such lending , " said andrei bokarev , an economic advisor to russian president dmitry medvedev . more disagreement ? despite conceding defeat on the bank taxes , merkel played down concerns about a greater rift in economic policy between europe and the united states . a disagreement appeared to be developing between washington and berlin in the run-up to the event in huntsville , near toronto .
us officials had voiced concerns that too much zeal in making cuts to tackle the budget deficits of european nations could hamper growth in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is against harsh spending cuts speaking after early discussions , merkel said she believed it was possible for countries to gain a tighter grip on public spending without derailing growth . " i have made it clear that we need sustainable growth and that growth and intelligent austerity measures do n't have to be contradictions , " merkel told journalists .
" the discussion was not controversial , there was a lot of mutual understanding , " she said . us president barack obama earlier insisted that national economic policies must focus on bolstering the recovery , rather than immediately tackling deficits . " this weekend in toronto i hope we can build on this progress by coordinating our efforts to promote economic growth , to pursue financial reform , and to strengthen the global economy , " obama said at the white house on friday . germany defends austerity measures merkel had said that g-8 members should start to cut their deficits immediately , despite fears that this could kill the global recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's angela merkel arrived in canada amid trans-atlantic tensions over economic policy " it is time to reduce the deficits .
europe has experienced what it means to have too big deficits , " she told journalists on arrival at the summit . merkel , as head of europe 's largest economy , has led moves to slash spending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis .
critics have said that the more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- in savings announced by merkel over the next four years will hit growth . " we need growth that does n't rely on debt , " merkel insisted .
" the world needs a new architecture for financial markets and the eu and i will push for that very intensively . " berlin has support in europe other eu countries , like britain , are following the german approach .
british prime minister david cameron arrived at his first major international summit days after laying out a budget aimed at tackling britain 's own record deficit .
cameron argued that a failure to reduce the deficit would pose an even bigger threat to the recovery . " there must be the flexibility for countries to act , taking account of their own national circumstances .
but i believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " cameron wrote in an article for canada 's globe and mail newspaper . however some , including france and the us , object to britain and germany 's cuts .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "

" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 25.06.2010 kyrgyzstan to vote in controversial referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks , who fled the unrest in southern kyrgyzstan , are slowly returning despite simmering tensions due to recent ethnic violence , voters in kyrgyzstan are being asked to go to the polls this sunday in a referendum over a new constitution . although thousands of people were affected by bloody clashes two weeks ago between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in the south of the country , kyrgyzstan 's interim government has insisted that a referendum on a new constitution take place .
a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.06.2010 europe worries over raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vast china is rich in numerous critical raw materials europe could face a severe shortage of raw materials needed for emerging technologies such as thin-film solar photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries , according to the european commission . the european commission has pushed the alarm button on raw materials after an expert group listed 14 materials facing a " critical " risk of shortage , some within a few years .
in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .
over 40 million people earn their livelihood as street vendors , small traders or shopkeepers in india . they used to be protected by strict regulatory laws but liberalization policies have taken away their safety net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the livelihoods of small traders are at risk from supermarkets and liberalization policies " millions are losing their livelihoods , and since there is no other social safety net and no other employment opportunity available for them , we are definitely heading towards a social disaster , " warned dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , an ngo that opposes foreign direct investment in the retail sector . development partnerships metro says it is promoting indian small-scale farming .
it has received help from the deg , a german development finance institution , to provide training programs for suppliers .
this has led to claims that germany 's development policies primarily serve the private sector . human rights organizations insist that the social responsibility of multinationals has to go beyond a corporate code of conduct . they also warn that official development aid should only be granted to foreign companies if wages are fair and people 's livelihoods are protected .
however , oxfam germany says that this is not the case when it comes to metro . author : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has called for 80 billion euros in austerity measures over the next four years , which diw economist jan goebel fears will only exacerbate poverty .
so far all the suggested cuts , he said , would " only hit people of lower income levels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan says democracy must create economic equality greater equality to fight poverty political scientist and former presidential candidate gesine schwan sees poverty as the manifestation of great injustice .
" it suggests that we must recall the original cry for justness , namely the basic equality of humankind in dignity , rights and obligations , " said schwan .
" through the democratic process , we must pursue concrete arrangements promoting equality when it comes to pensions , taxes , access to jobs and education , " she added .
schwan believes that the creation of a more just society must involve closing the gap between rich and poor – a goal which she said she does not see the current federal government working toward .
schwan wants to see a stronger stance from the government to lead the public consciousness , in which there is no concensus on fighting poverty .
" those who are better-off hold the main responsibility , " she said .
" a callous claim that the market must prevail unobstructed is just as much an affront to justice as a claim of ownership over the costs of unemployment or of coming generations . "
decent work for decent pay poverty even affects the middle-class in germany , which still has no minimum wage .
since the early 1970s , earned income rates have sunk relative to national income .
the number of low-income jobs has also grown - and with it the number of people who can not live off their earnings .
social democrat malu dreyer explained that this phenomenon can have drastic consequences on society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children who grow up in poverty usually remain there having a minimum wage and giving giving welfare aid commensurate with the decision of the federal constitutional court , she said , are essential to ending poverty in germany .
though there is no apparent end to poverty in sight , experts agree that there wo n't be social unrest any time soon in germany .
instead of fighting for greater equality , it 's believed that poor people in germany more often focus their discontent inward , triggering illness and affective disorders .
for that reason , it is not rare for children growing up in poverty to suffer depression .

italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

behind the painted line , protesters wear tee-shirts displaying the words " i am indebted and am poor , " " i have no education and am poor " or " i 'm a single parent and am poor . "
the red line here represents the poverty line , under which one in seven germans lives - approximately 15 percent .
in europe the poverty rate comprises 17 percent of the population , or some 84 million people .
surveys show that the situation has worsened in recent years .
a recently-published european union study states that three quarters of eu citizens perceive growing poverty in their home countries .
even in germany , 57 percent surveyed said they felt poverty was increasing around them .
according to another recent study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , from 2000 to 2009 , poverty in germany increased from 18 to nearly 22 percent .
yet with germany boasting europe 's strongest economy and one of the highest living standards in the world , the german definition of poverty is not restricted to starvation and homelessness .
living in dignity with little money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in germany live below the poverty line that was the conclusion of germany 's federal constitutional court earlier this year , when it declared the then-standard unemployment benefit rates unlawful .
the move was a groundbreaking decision , according to malu dreyer , minister of labor and social affairs in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
" the federal constitutional court in this case not only codified the basic right to a minimum subsistence level fit for human beings , but also made clear that a modicum of participation in social , cultural and political life must also be part of that . "
nearly 7 million people live off state aid in germany , and about 2.5 million of them are minors , according to the charity organization caritas .
poverty among children in germany has nearly doubled since 2004 , which could mean a new wave of poverty in future years , as poor children have a much lower chance at getting a good education than their wealthier peers and and most often remain poor into adulthood .
dreyer is careful to speak of germany 's needy not as charity cases , but as citizens who have a right to participate in society .
" by the same token the government has the obligation to safeguard them , " she said yet , germany may not be able to afford the kind of social responsibility to which its residents have grown accustomed .

what happened next may change the way parliament does business . who would have thought that an ipad tablet computer would cause a parliamentary incident ?
jimmy schulz , a backbencher in the german bundestag for the liberal free democrats , certainly did n't think so !
that 's why he thought nothing of taking his ipad to the podium to present a speech .
perhaps , no one would have noticed , if his brand-new 3g device had n't crashed in the middle of his address - for the whole world to see .
but , what turned out to be just a minor embarrassment for mr. schulz , now has the parliamentary rules committee in the german bundestag mulling the question of whether to allow digital devices , which until now had been banned .
tradition versus the digital age more traditional voices argue that things were never done that way before , or that it detracts from the dignity and gravity of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz got more media attention than he bargained for jimmy schulz , on the other hand , told deutsche welle that even chancellor merkel and other members of her cabinet can be seen using their blackberries discreetly during a debate .
" even if it 's not allowed , most of us are doing it .
and i was just the first one to use , well , a more appropriate media for that ; a larger tool where you can read the things , and reply to emails better than what you can do with your smartphone , " said schulz .
it was a completely new situation for the young politician .
he has never had so much attention .
at the time he did it , he says , no one said anything .
there was just some murmuring in the background .
most people , he thought , did n't even know what sort of device he was holding .
he admits that he had only purchased his ipad a few hours before his parliamentary address and was n't really up-to-speed on how to use it .
since then , two weeks have gone by , and he says now it 's really a great device to have .
" in fact , i use it as a digital briefcase or digital notepad .
i have to carry lots of paperwork all day and i can get rid of most of the paperwork with that tool , " schulz emphasized. ipad wo n't replace the personal encounter jo groebel , director of the german digital institute in berlin , fully agrees with jimmy schulz , and said that electronic devices are an acceptable tool for gathering information - as long as " that information can be regarded as reliable and valid . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag - out with the old , in with the new ?
" what 's the down side of the whole thing ?
to just omit parliament and just say let 's do it electronically .
of course , that does take away a lot of personal contact , a lot of informal contact , a lot of face-to-face contact , which can not be simulated with electronic devices , " he told deutsche welle .
groebel noted , however , that there is a major danger in doing everything digitally .
" one never could be sure that the whole thing is manipulated , " he warned .
" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

" one thing is that there is a person giving a speech , being there , being accountable and being able to be identified , and the other is , let 's say , an electronic network , where you could never tell whether it has been manipulated or not , " groebel said .
backbencher jimmy schulz hopes that the parliamentary rules committee recognizes that at least the younger crop of lawmakers in the german bundestag lives in the digital age .
the time has come , he says .
but - somewhat sheepishly - he admitted that maybe next time , he 'll memorize his speech .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 25.06.2010 italians protest berlusconi 's austerity plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi insists the cuts are vital for italy 's future italian workers walked out in a protest against austerity cuts , disrupting transport services across the country .
italy 's largest union organised the day of strike action , with marches in nearly every major city . italy 's largest union staged a national general strike on friday in a protest against austerity measures by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's centre-right government .
transport services across the country were disrupted , though support for the strike was not universal .
the left-leaning cgil union , which has six million members , staged rallies in nearly every major italian city in a bid to force the government to rethink a 25-billion-euro package of cuts .
berlusconi has defended the package as “ absolutely necessary ” and hopes it will help save the euro currency .
the austerity measures include a 10 percent budget reduction for ministries , 4.5 billion euros in reduced transfers to regional governments , a partial amnesty on illegal building and a 3-year wage freeze for civil servants .
" no one denies that we need to make cuts , but they must be cuts which are fair and look to the future , rather than just slashing spending , " said susanna camusso , deputy leader of the cgil , at a rally in bologna .
the strike was a key test of strength for berlusconi , whose poll ratings have reached new lows as unemployment has risen and the euro zone 's third largest economy has struggled to emerge from recession .
loyalties divided the strike split italy 's trade union movement , which is roughly divided along political lines .
the other two main unions asked their members to stay on the job .
while most private sector cgil workers went on strike for four hours , public sector members demonstrated their anger by staying off work all day .
bus , subway and rail services were disrupted throughout the country , although support for the strike was patchy and some services continued to run .
airport staff also planned to strike , but flights at rome 's fiumicino airport appeared to suffer little disruption .
the strikes followed union protests in france and greece this week against plans for pension reform and budget cuts .
members of the 16-nation euro zone have rushed to approve austerity measures in a bid to restore confidence in the single currency and stop greece 's debt crisis spilling over into other countries .
thousands marched in rome on june 12 to protest against the government 's austerity measures .
polls say a majority of italians believe the cuts are unfairly distributed , even though part of the package includes pay cuts for parliamentarians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 25.06.2010 oxfam germany accuses metro of violating indian workers rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro is one of the top retailers in europe and has expanded to asia the german wholesaler metro has cash & carry stores in five major indian cities .
but oxfam germany accuses it of violating workers ’ rights and says that its strategy could jeopardize millions of jobs . in a recently-published study , oxfam germany quotes metro workers as saying that if there is work , they have to stay - regardless of whether this means ten , 12 or 16 hours a day - and they do not get extra money . union members also report discrimination with regard to salary increases and promotions .
moreover , agricultural laborers have been found to receive wages below the poverty line , according to franziska humbert from oxfam germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular in india among the middle-classes " if we look at metro 's standards of corporate social responsibility , there is a considerable gap between the idea and the reality , " humbert explained . metro committed to social code of conduct the accusations weigh all the more heavily , as the metro group is supposedly committed to a social code of conduct . metro spokesman michael inacker has dismissed the findings from oxfam 's study .
" all providers have to comply with the company 's social and ecological standards .
this means that they accept to pay their workers the legal minimum wage , " he said . however , he did add that it was impossible to control how much the thousands of farmers they employ paid their hands each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro workers in india report having to do overtime without extra pay humbert from oxfam said that metro should assume responsibility for everybody in the supply chain .
" agricultural workers often earn no more than 85 euro cents per day .
this is well below the legal minimum wage .
they work for small-scale farmers and thus belong to the metro supply chain .
it is their right to receive the minimum wage .
therefore we can talk about violations . " future of retail trade in india ? oxfam is not only worried about compliance with labor laws but also about the future of the retail trade in india .

turkey 's archaic censorship laws are drawing criticism from europe . earlier this month , turkey announced it would ban access to some google services and web pages .
the ban is the result of a clash between google and the turkish government .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .

the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

a first stage of voting was held on friday for nearly 2,000 kyrgyz soldiers in osh , the country 's second-largest city , and epicenter of the bloodshed .
" the boys are voting -lrb- on friday -rrb- so they can be on high alert on election day , " said abdykalyk boltabayev , a local election official .
shift in power at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's interim government leader roza otunbayeva hopes the referendum will bring stability among the proposals in the constitution are a shift in power from the president to the parliament , and a decree to allow roza otunbayeva to stay on in her role as interim president until the end of 2011 .
at that point , presidential elections would be held , but otunbayeva would be excluded from the candidacy .
kyrgyzstan 's deputy prime minister almasbek atambayev has said it 's important that the vote take place as planned , and has even suggested that the recent clashes in the south were designed to torpedo the referendum .
" if the referendum fails , it will give certain forces an opportunity to foment more chaos and keep the country unstable , " atambayev said .
observers say otunbayeva needs the vote to give legitimacy to her government , which has never formally been voted in , and to pave the way for formal diplomatic recognition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyz soldiers check passing cars and search passengers for weapons on the uzbek border side of the southern kyrgyz city of osh the government is reportedly doing everything it can to ensure that people in the southern part of the country will be able to participate on sunday .
since many uzbeks there are still wary of going out on the street , the government is taking the vote to the people in the form of mobile ballot boxes .
atambayev said the government was also talking to neighboring uzbekistan to get tens of thousands of refugees to return to kyrgyzstan to vote .
data released on friday by the united nations indicated that most of those who fled kyrgyzstan two weeks ago have started to return .
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- estimated that there are some 15,000 refugees still in uzbekistan , but said the figures were provisional .
" it does n't mean at all that the emergency is over , " said ocha spokeswoman elisabeth byrs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man examines a burnt car in osh following the riots that erupted on june 10 clashes erupted in the volatile regions of southern kyrgyzstan on june 10 , where ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks make up a roughly equal share of the population .
both sides say they were attacked by the other .
the government did not intervene , although ethnic uzbeks say government troops sided with kyrgyz attackers who rampaged through uzbek neighborhoods and torched uzbek homes .
the government estimates that as many as 2,000 people were killed .
the south was the stronghold of the country 's ousted president , kurmanbek bakiyev , who was forced into exile following a bloody uprising in april .
on friday , kyrgyz authorities said they had arrested bakiyev 's nephew , whom they accuse of organizing the recent ethnic violence .
they claim that 27-year-old sandjar bakiyev hired taliban and other islamist militants to stir up the unrest .
a poor but strategic country the united states and russia both operate military bases in kyrgyzstan , and are anxious to prevent the turmoil from spreading to other countries in central asia : a region which is not only rich in oil and gas , but also lies along a drug-trafficking route from afghanistan .
" we hope the electoral process will form a fully-fledged government capable of resolving the problems facing the state , " said russian president dmitry medvedev during a visit to washington .
" we are all concerned that , in these conditions , radicals could come to power , and then we will have to resolve the same sort of problems that we are tackling in other regions , such as afghanistan . "
at the height of the violence earlier this month , however , russian declined a request to send peacekeeping troops to kyrgyzstan .
critics call vote a " farce " however , the chorus of voices in the country saying that it 's impossible to hold a referendum under such conditions is growing louder .
last week , major general omurbek suvanaliyev , the police chief of osh , resigned out of protest , saying he would not be part of a vote which he considers to be " an immoral farce . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev says it 's important to stop the turmoil from spreading it is also still unclear whether the international community will accept the results of sunday 's vote , which will unfold largely in the absence of observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
the osce canceled plans to send up to 300 observers to kyrgyzstan , due to the current security situation .
galina skripkina , a member of the kyrgyz election commission , told deutsche welle that there were only 36 osce monitors in the country .
" the osce canceled their participation , and no concrete reason was given , " she said .
" they only said it was impossible to guarantee the safety of the observers . "
the lack of observers aside , skripkina said that a more pressing problem is the lack of regulations regarding the referendum , including what minimum level of participation was necessary for the results to be binding .
according to the country 's current laws , a minimum of 50 percent voter participation is required .
but in the days leading up to the vote , the government said it was n't expecting such a high turn-out .
it suggested lowering the participation level to 30 or even 20 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.06.2010 europe worries over raw materials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vast china is rich in numerous critical raw materials europe could face a severe shortage of raw materials needed for emerging technologies such as thin-film solar photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries , according to the european commission . the european commission has pushed the alarm button on raw materials after an expert group listed 14 materials facing a " critical " risk of shortage , some within a few years .
in a report published this week , the commission warned that demand for the materials could more than triple within 20 years .
a key factor behind the shortages , according to the report , is the concentration of production in just a handful of countries , such as china , brazil , russia and the democratic republic of congo , compounded by low substitutability and recycling rates .
tigthtening control of materials the report also attributes the shortages to the way some of these countries use trade and taxation policies to reserve their resource bases for exclusive use .
china , for instance , plans to tighten control over its rare-earth minerals by allowing only a select number of state-owned companies to oversee the mining of its materials .
the country accounts for 95 percent of global rare-earth mineral production .
ahead of the report 's publication , european union commissioner for enterprise , antonio tajani , spoke of a need for " fair play " on raw material markets to ensure access to scarce elements by european industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raw materials are in few hands the 14 materials identified by the commission 's working group out of 41 minerals and metals are antimony , beryllium , cobalt , fluorspar , gallium , indium , germanium , graphite , magnesium , niobium , platinum group metals , rare earths , tantalum and tungsten .
furthermore , the study warns that materials markets could become highly volatile due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies that " can drastically change the demand for critical raw materials . "
recommendations to overcome shortages demand for gallium , which is mainly produced in china , could increase from its total current production of 152 tons to 603 by 2030 , according to the report .
and demand for neodymium , a rare earth also found predominately in china , could grow from 16,800 tons today to 27,900 tons over the same period .
the european union expert group has made several recommendations to overcome the shortage problem , including proposals designed to boost mineral recycling , identify alternative materials and promote greater exploration .
the group also recommends that the eu " consider the merits of pursuing dispute settlement initiatives " at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- level to ensure the supply of important raw materials to european industry .
' raw materials dialog ' german economics minister rainer bruederle has responded to the material shortage by initiating a " raw materials dialog " initiative and inviting industry to participate in discussions on how to secure a steady supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economics minister rainer bruederle is considering a raw materials agency government officials and industry representatives met for the second time earlier this week to discuss , among other topics , the launch of a raw materials agency .
the agency , organized within the german federal institute for geology and raw materials , would be responsible for monitoring global raw materials markets . " raw material security is paramount to the sustainability of german industry , " ullrich grillo , chairman of grillo-werke , a chemicals and minerals company and of the raw material working committee of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" without high-tech metals and also basic materials such as aluminum , copper and zinc , german industry is in danger . " grillo added that it 's not enough for raw material policy to be discussed at g8 and g20 summits ; it needs to become a topic in bilateral negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 25.06.2010 german court rules in favor of passive assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say legislation on assisted suicide in germany is unclear germany 's federal court of justice has ruled that assisted suicide is legal in certain cases .
the ruling is based on a case involving a terminally-ill coma patient whose daughter attempted to cut her feeding tube . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled that passive assisted suicide is legal if the patient has explicitly decreed his or her wish that treatment used to keep the patient alive should be terminated .
" turning off a ventilator or cutting a feeding tube fall under the category of permissable forms of terminating treatment , " judge ruth rissing van saan said .
the ruling by the federal court of justice refers to a case involving erika kuellmer , a then terminally-ill patient in her seventies , who had been in a coma for five years .
prior to becoming unconscious , she indicated to her daughter that she would not want to be kept alive should she fall into a coma .
on the advice of her solicitor wolfgang putz , who specializes in medical law , the daughter tried to help her die by cutting the tube that was feeding her mother .
but staff at the care home intervened and the patient survived another two weeks before dying a natural death .
patient 's wishes key putz , who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by a court in fulda last year , has now been acquitted .
the law on passive assisted suicide was previously unclear or , at least , difficult to interpret . in 1994 , the federal court ruled that if the patient has given his or her putative consent , treatment can be terminated .
this was the legal basis for putz in kuellmer 's case .
but , until now , it was unclear when terminating treatment would be considered a criminal offense .
passive assisted suicide is also legal if the process of dying has irreversibly begun .
but with modern medicine capable of keeping patients alive artificially , it is often tricky to determine when that process has set in .
in 2005 , the federal court ruled that no care home or similar institution has the right to force a patient to be fed through a tube against their will .
in addition , new legislation was introduced last year that states that the patient 's wishes have to be considered at all times until death .
active assisted suicide remains illegal in germany .
killing someone by injection or other means , even if the patient consents , is punishable by up to five years in prison .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

however , the south africans will also be jubilant after the final .
they have managed to make the mega event a success : images of the modern stadiums as well as the dynamic cities cape town , durban and johannesburg are seen around the world .
in addition , the football-crazy population is infectious with its euphoria and vitality .
all of this lets the country shine in a positive light – an effect that was intended .
projecting a dynamic image of africa despite prevailing poverty never before were so many expectations – beyond those of purely sporting interest – set for a world cup .
the prospect of a kind of " development double pack " has been held out : on the one hand , south africa was hoped to continue to develop by profiting from the investments and tourists who have been lured by the world cup .
on the other hand , the perception of the rest of the world should change .
the idea was that a new image of africa should emerge , beyond poverty , hunger , epidemics and violence .
indeed , a much-vaunted change of image appears to have taken place in the last few days .
reports in the economic press about the coming into existence of major african companies and the market potential of many countries , also present africa as a continent of possibilities .
and yet , despite the images that are currently going around the world , images of modern and dynamic south africa in many areas of life , we can not afford to forget that in many african countries there is still abject poverty , hunger , a miserable health care system and an emphasis on violence to resolve conflicts .
south africa acting as ambassador for the whole continent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die 's christian von drachenfels since the end of apartheid , south africa itself has always been committed to the continent , has been heavily involved in the african union and in its declarations always placed itself on the side of the african countries .
in fact , however , south africa is playing in a different league .
the socio-economic development is much more advanced than in the rest of the continent .
this is clearly evident from the fact that it would not be possible to host such an event in any other african country .
that 's why we also owe south africa our respect : it has assumed the role of ambassador for the entire continent during the world cup and played this role impressively ; for example when archbishop desmond tutu declared all guests to the world cup to be africans , since africa is ultimately the cradle of humanity .
many will not benefit from the world cup beyond south africa 's role as ambassador , the question about the impact of the world cup on the host country itself remains .
economically , world cups are often risky for the host countries .
like in previous host countries , the expenses have increased continuously since the world cup was awarded to south africa in 2004 .
according to the most recent estimates , the south african government has now invested around 4 billion euro for new constructions and the modernization of stadiums and transport infrastructure .
against the background that the unemployment rate in south africa is 25 percent , an estimated 5.7 million people are hiv positive , around 20 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and 30 percent does not have access to improved sanitary facilities , a critical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the world cup is appropriate .
there are serious points of criticism : the corruption scandals in some stadium constructions and the banning of small businesses from the areas around the stadiums and fan fests due to pressure from fifa .
in addition , rural areas hardly profit from the investments connected with the world cup , while in south africa 's cities , complex measures for modernization beyond the centers are required .
measures that were taken under substantial time pressure and to some extent without sufficiently consulting the population were not always found to be ideal .
increasing tourism could be among the positive impacts of the world cup good developments are just as obvious however .
despite all concerns and criticism of politics and the administration , south africa has demonstrated its ability to perform and at the same time sent a positive signal to foreign investors .
moreover , the additional visitors strengthen the tourist industry even in the weak overall winter season .
through their reports , the attractiveness of the travel destination south africa can increase significantly .
something positive can be gained even from the cases of corruption and other negative reports : the south african civil society and the media discover the scandals , criticize precisely and accurately , thus holding politicians , the administration and the private sector accountable .
the next few years will be particularly exiting , since they will show whether the hopes that poor south africans have put in the world cup will be fulfilled .
the country will still need a lot of time in order to reduce the extreme income inequality and raise the overall standard of living in the entire country .
to live up to these challenges requires social cohesion , patience and constructive action by all actors of society .
it is to be hoped that in the coming years all this will happen in south africa .
for the moment however south africans deserve a cup for the fact alone that contrary to initial fears the world cup is up and running and the ball is rolling .

susan lineaker has three children over the age of 15 , and her six month grandaughter also often stays at her house .
she says that she is not concerned that the foxes are a danger to them , despite an attack on two babies by foxes on saturday 5 june , which left the infants badly mauled .
however , bracknell forest council had planned to shoot and kill the foxes at the request of bracknell forest homes and bracknell forest council .
following a campaign by susan , the foxes will now be left alone .
she said : " we regularly watch the foxes during the evening out of the windows , a mum and a dad and three cubs . "
susan was appalled to receive a letter laying out the housing association 's plans to shoot the foxes .
she started to campaign to have them saved , and enlisted the help of her neighbours .
" there was absolutely no way when i got this letter that i was prepared to take it lying down , " she said .
" if you treat foxes with respect , they tend not to bother human beings . "
bracknell forest homes said : " we are responding to long term complaints and concerns from residents about urban foxes .
" we have cancelled the appointment with the pest control contractor and are seeking advice about alternative effective methods in line with recommendations from experts . "
but how dangerous are foxes to humans ?
urban wildlife expert john bryant said such an attack was extremely rare .
" this case in hackney where they attacked the twins is completely unprecedented , " he said .
" it 's completely unique , and i 've never come across like anything like it in the past , " he said .
" mass hysteria has been whipped up . "
the university of bristol 's mammal research unit estimates there are 225,000 adult rural foxes and 33,000 urban foxes across britain .
according to the university these numbers have stayed the same over the last decade .
in a poll of nearly 4,000 households , 65.7 % liked urban foxes , 25.8 % had no strong views and only 8.5 % disliked the creatures .

there she worked with " people in crisis " who had been seriously hurt in accidents and needed help from consultants in burns trauma and spinal injuries at the specialist buckinghamshire hospital .
rev blagden is relishing her first incumbency working as rector for bangor monachorum , worthenbury and marchwiel .
" i 'm looking forward to journeying with a community of people over a period of time , " she said .
" that was something that was never possible in the hospital because people were in and out reasonably quickly , so it will be really lovely to journey with a group of people for some years and share that faith journey together . "
rev blagden 's role is one of several new posts announced by the bishop of st asaph to the diocese .
the other appointments are the rev sarah errington , team vicar in the rectorial benefice of wrexham ; the rev ian forster , team vicar in the rectorial benefice of hawarden ; and the rev sally rogers , rector of the parishes of petryal with betws yn rhos . "
it feels like a very hallowed , sacred space " rev susan blagden , speaking about bangor on dee church reflecting on her previous work experience , rev blagden said : " at stoke mandeville hospital i was working with people in crisis , people who had been involved in accidents and ended up in a & e and people who had spinal injuries because we had the national spinal injuries centre .
" we also had a regional burns unit so i 'd be working with people who had been involved in fires , doing some intense work over reasonably short periods of time as they sought to find meaning in the experiences that had happened to them . "
before rev blagden was appointed , the parish drew up a list of what they were expecting from their new incumbent .
this included someone who was able to visit the sick and the housebound and rev blagden is eager to stress that the church is able to go to people in their own homes .
" the church is definitely made up of a community of people who happen to gather in a building that 's called the church and i would very much hope that we will continue to be an outward-looking group of parishes involved in village life . "
the parishioners also wanted a priest who was committed to prayer .
" there 's clearly an invitation from the parishes here to explore a little more about the experience and practice of prayer which i shall be delighted to help them with , " said rev blagden .
rev blagden is looking forward to getting to know the fascinating features of each of the churches she is now responsible for and explained how the chancel of st dunawd 's in bangor on dee is built on the site of an ancient monastery .
" there 's some debate as to just how large that monastery was but i did feel when i looked around without knowing that fact , that there was a different quality to the air in the chancel .
it feels like a very hallowed , sacred space . "

the scenes of everyday life in gloucestershire were inspired by a virtual model of dursley , created for google earth by local retired architect john wilkes .
the artist has never visited dursley , and based his watercolour pictures on images available online on the google earth website .
john smith said : " john wilkes ' models were very good and inspired me to make some ' scenes ' with them .

six horseshoe crabs have arrived at the aquarium and , as well as providing a fascinating new feature , the crabs will also play an important cleaning role .
blue reef 's david waines said : " the crabs burrow through the sand searching for small organisms to feed on , making tracks and ploughing up the surface as they go .
the horseshoe crabs clean their living environment as they go " this keeps the substrate that sits in some tough-to-reach areas clean and bright .
" it 's a great example of natural behaviour being used instead of mechanical filters to keep a display clean , " david says .
horseshoe crabs have been living in our seas for an estimated 300 million years - long before the dinosaurs .
their appearance is similar to the prehistoric and extinct trilobite .
a distinctive feature of the horseshoe is its long tail-like spine - which is known as a telson .
although it looks dangerous it is actually not a weapon at all but a way for the animal to right itself if it gets turned on its back .
horseshoe crabs have four pairs of walking legs with a claw at the end of each .
there is also a fifth pair that helps the crab lurch forward .
its mouth is actually located in between the base of the legs and the horseshoe crab can only eat when it is moving .
see these fascinating creatures at newquay 's blue reef aquarium .
