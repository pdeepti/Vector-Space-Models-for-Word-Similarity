spanish rider alberto contador took the yellow jersey as the overall winner of the race , while the great lance armstrong bowed out . alberto contador won the 2010 tour de france on sunday , as the world 's most prestigious bike race enjoyed its ceremonial last day on paris ' champs elysees .
british sprinter mark cavendish took the stage victory , his fifth of the tour , as the riders finally hit top speed when they reached the french capital .
but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

spanish rider alberto contador took the yellow jersey as the overall winner of the race , while the great lance armstrong bowed out . alberto contador won the 2010 tour de france on sunday , as the world 's most prestigious bike race enjoyed its ceremonial last day on paris ' champs elysees .
british sprinter mark cavendish took the stage victory , his fifth of the tour , as the riders finally hit top speed when they reached the french capital .
but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

spanish rider alberto contador took the yellow jersey as the overall winner of the race , while the great lance armstrong bowed out . alberto contador won the 2010 tour de france on sunday , as the world 's most prestigious bike race enjoyed its ceremonial last day on paris ' champs elysees .
british sprinter mark cavendish took the stage victory , his fifth of the tour , as the riders finally hit top speed when they reached the french capital .
but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 25.07.2010 berlin paper girls give the gift of art to passers-by großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolled up , the artworks are easy to slip through car windows or into people 's hands they do n't deliver newspapers , but instead , berlin 's ' paper girls ' whiz by on bicycles , stopping only to drop artworks in mailboxes or hand them out on the street . in berlin , some young women have taken the idea of newspaper delivery to a whole new level .
armagan isbay is one person to benefit from the service .
sitting in front of his pizzeria in a quiet corner of berlin 's wedding district , someone tosses something to him .
instinctively , he catches it and then unrolls the package to reveal graphic and silk-screen prints and photographs .
before he can even jump up to thank the delivery woman , she speeds off again on her bike .
the woman is one of a group who call themselves the " paper girls . "
they slide rolled up works of art through car windows while drivers are sitting at street lights , or leave them on low balconies in courtyards , or even slip them into an open bag or purse in a cafe .
they also pass by dozens of pedestrians each day and toss them packages , like they did for isbay .
bildunterschrift : on tour in berlin : project coordinator aisha ronniger 's special bike makes her rather conspicuous to potential art recipients sitting atop her high " mutant bicycle , " aisha ronniger , who is in charge of the project , explained that it all started as a joke among design students four years ago .
meanwhile , it has turned the street art scene around the world upside down .
ronniger found a way of getting around bans on hanging up posters in public areas .
" you just have to throw the artworks right in front of people 's noses , " she said .
the project has grown each year since its inception , becoming more international and multimedial .
nearly 240 artists from 18 different countries have sent their works - both originals and copies - to ronniger to be considered for the project .
bloggers , filmmakers and photographers have also helped to promote the idea around the world and make it more international .
berlin 's " paper girls " now have sisters in new york , cape town , bucharest and manchester .
analog and anachronistic ronniger 's art project takes an anachronistic approach that stresses both the art of giving and technical expertise , which she believes is disappearing more and more in our digitized world .
" the internet prevents a feel for the dimensions of a work of art , and for its haptics , as well as for the value of the artwork itself , " she said .
bildunterschrift : a surprise is always waiting inside some of the project 's artworks take true and false friends - and everyday life as it occurs on the internet - as their subjects .
artist sp38 's posters scream " i do n't wanna be u 're friend on facebook . "
claudia berhardt 's work shows a woman with a suitcase , who has remembered to pack everything , but does n't know her destination .
" which way ? " reads the speech bubble .
chance decides , at any rate , which direction the project 's art will go .
after a two-hour tour around the city distributing the works at random , " the only thing left over is adrenaline , " said ronniger , stopping at a street light .
street art as luxury item andreea gazdaru and bianca mihai want some of that light-heartedness to come to their home town of bucharest when they start the first paper girl festival there in september .
" street art is a luxury in romania , " said gazdaru , who has a scholarship to participate in the berlin project , just like some of her other international colleagues .
" many of the people i know would like to submit their works , but can not even afford the costs of printing , " the 25-year-old regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all rolled up and ready to go nevertheless , she 's certain the project will stirs things up in bucharest .
" everything still has its place in romania , " she said .
" people believe art belongs in museums , and cars on the street . "
marcii goose has tried to launch the paper girls project in cape town , but has n't had an easy time of it .
when she tosses things to people on the street , they panic , the south african said .
" they usually think a rock is being thrown at them , " she said .
for paper girls ' third run in cape town 's woodstock neighborhood , where many poor people , as well as artists , live , rather than throwing the artworks through the air , she took the time to place them in people 's hands and talk with the lucky recipients .
" we do n't want to provoke people ; we just want to make them happy , " she said .
the 32-year-old had read about the paper girls project on the internet and decided it was time for a change in her life .
" as a creative director for 10 years , i put art at the mercy of commerce - and at some point , i no longer recognized myself , " she recalled .
" that 's changed now . "
just around the corner the future for paper girls in berlin , at any rate , is uncertain .
aisha ronniger has just finished her training as a graphic designer and is ready to pass over the reins .
there are n't many around who want to fill her shoes , though .
bildunterschrift : armagan isbay is thrilled with the artworks pizza maker armagan isbay may be one of the last to receive art from the paper girls .
" god has heard my prayers , " he quipped , " i had just thought , ' how great it would be if a little more life came into this downbeat corner of the neighborhood . '
and then , i got this tossed into my lap ! "

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

spanish rider alberto contador took the yellow jersey as the overall winner of the race , while the great lance armstrong bowed out . alberto contador won the 2010 tour de france on sunday , as the world 's most prestigious bike race enjoyed its ceremonial last day on paris ' champs elysees .
british sprinter mark cavendish took the stage victory , his fifth of the tour , as the riders finally hit top speed when they reached the french capital .
but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

spanish rider alberto contador took the yellow jersey as the overall winner of the race , while the great lance armstrong bowed out . alberto contador won the 2010 tour de france on sunday , as the world 's most prestigious bike race enjoyed its ceremonial last day on paris ' champs elysees .
british sprinter mark cavendish took the stage victory , his fifth of the tour , as the riders finally hit top speed when they reached the french capital .
but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

the festival-goers were crushed in a tunnel on their way to festival grounds , according to police . at least 19 people died after a stampede broke out at the love parade techno music festival in the western german city of duisburg on saturday .
authorities in duisburg scheduled a press conference for sunday to detail the cause of the mass panic . the tragedy occurred in a tunnel on the way to the festival grounds as police were trying to prevent people from entering the overcrowded site .
thousands of fans had been walking along a hundred-meter pathway toward the festival for several hours . in interviews with german media , eyewitnesses questioned the safety of the 200-meter -lrb- 650-foot -rrb- long and 30-meter wide tunnel that served as the love parade 's main access . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tunnel served as the main entrance to the love parade there was also some concern ahead of the festival that duisburg 's former railway freight yard would not be able to accommodate all the party-goers .
in an interview with der westen , organizers said the venue could hold up to 500,000 people .
some 1.4 million people were estimated to have attended the event , about 200,000 less than the previous year 's love parade in dortmund . duisburg police commissioner juergen kieskemper described the situation as " very chaotic , " and said they were still trying to determine exactly what happened . city authorities earlier confirmed that 15 people had died and said an additional 80 were injured in the tunnel .
facing the crush of the crowd , paramedics had difficulty getting through to the site .
police later said that 16 people had died at the scene and that a further three had died of their injuries . early on sunday , police drastically increased the number of people reported injured to 342 . ' no turning back ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site festival-goers described a mass of people pushing with unstoppable force . it took sergei benkogenov and vitaly dippel from hamm three hours to reach the festival grounds from duisburg 's train station .
at some point , they wondered if their efforts were worth it . " we really would have liked to turn around and go home , but it was impossible , " said 19-year-old benkogenov .
" there was no turning back . " " no one knew where the love parade started , " bekogenov added .
" the line was endless . " right before reports of the stampede , with thousands in line waiting to get in , police announced at 5:34 p.m. that the festival grounds had reached capacity and were being closed . " the police announced by loudspeaker that participants should return in the direction of the train station , " said one eyewitness . authorities , however , later said at a press conference saturday at the duisburg city hall that the festival grounds were not yet filled at the time of the tragedy . merkel , wulff express condolences german chancellor angela merkel offered her sympathy to the victims ' families , saying she was horrified by the day 's events . " the young people came to celebrate , instead there were deaths and injuries , " she said .
" i am appalled and distressed at the suffering and pain . " german president christian wulff also expressed his condolences saturday evening in berlin for the victims of the tragedy that had " caused death , sorrow and pain amidst a peaceful festival of cheerful young people from many countries . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party went on " for security reasons " " my thoughts are with the victims of the tragedy and with all their family and friends , " wulff said , adding that he hoped for a full explanation as to the causes of the incident . the mayor of duisburg , adolf sauerland , said that safety arrangements put in place by the city and festival organizers had been substantial .
he also said an investigation to determine the precise cause of the tragedy had been started . " in the run-up to the event , we worked out a solid security plan with the organizers and everyone involved , " he said .
" my thoughts are with the victims and their relatives .
the love parade is supposed to be a peaceful and joyful celebration . " north rhine-westphalia state premier hannelore kraft expressed her own shock and said that investigators would need time to establish what had happened . party goes on spokesman frank kopatschek told news agency dpa on saturday evening that " the city of duisburg 's action committee has decided not to end the festival for now , for safety reasons . " kopatschek said the city was concerned about preventing further panic among the 1.4 million people in attendance . organizers ended their live streaming of the event , replacing it with a message that offered " sincere condolences " to relatives . police have activated a hotline for family members of festival-goers anxious about the well-being of their loved ones . the love parade festival began in berlin in 1989 but moved to the ruhr region in 2007 .
it also led to numerous other events around the world being held under the " love parade " banner . author : david levitz , richard connor -lrb- afp / ap / apn / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of fans had been walking along a hundred-meter pathway toward the festival for several hours . in interviews with german media , eyewitnesses questioned the safety of the 200-meter -lrb- 650-foot -rrb- long and 30-meter wide tunnel that served as the love parade 's main access . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tunnel served as the main entrance to the love parade there was also some concern ahead of the festival that duisburg 's former railway freight yard would not be able to accommodate all the party-goers .

simultaneously , others attempt to move in the opposite direction to return to the railway station .
the air begins to thin and panic builds as some attempt to escape - to no avail .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

examples she gave included soccer champion mesut oezil and lower saxony 's family affairs minister ayguel oezkan , as well as the growing number of migrants attending elite high schools and universities .

but all eyes were on contador , as the battle for the yellow jersey for the overall race winner became a procession on the closing day .
the 27-year-old astana team rider finished in yellow for the third time , securing a fifth successive tour victory for a spaniard .
a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .
luxembourger schleck had to content himself with second place and the white jersey for the best young rider .
chain controversy the memory of contador 's triumph may be tainted by the way he grabbed the race lead in monday 's fifteenth stage in the pyrenees mountains though .
the chain slipped on schleck 's bike towards the end of the stage , and he was forced to stop to repair it .
contador broke tour etiquette by taking the opportunity to attack , and gained a crucial 30 seconds ' advantage .
he was booed as he was presented with the yellow jersey after the stage , and later admitted he had made a mistake .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark cavendish confirmed his status as the fastest man on two wheels on sunday " i 've had difficult days , from a psychological and a physical point of view , " contador admitted from the top of the podium on sunday .
" i am happy , very happy . "
the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 25.07.2010 berlin paper girls give the gift of art to passers-by großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolled up , the artworks are easy to slip through car windows or into people 's hands they do n't deliver newspapers , but instead , berlin 's ' paper girls ' whiz by on bicycles , stopping only to drop artworks in mailboxes or hand them out on the street . in berlin , some young women have taken the idea of newspaper delivery to a whole new level .
armagan isbay is one person to benefit from the service .
sitting in front of his pizzeria in a quiet corner of berlin 's wedding district , someone tosses something to him .
instinctively , he catches it and then unrolls the package to reveal graphic and silk-screen prints and photographs .
before he can even jump up to thank the delivery woman , she speeds off again on her bike .
the woman is one of a group who call themselves the " paper girls . "
they slide rolled up works of art through car windows while drivers are sitting at street lights , or leave them on low balconies in courtyards , or even slip them into an open bag or purse in a cafe .
they also pass by dozens of pedestrians each day and toss them packages , like they did for isbay .
bildunterschrift : on tour in berlin : project coordinator aisha ronniger 's special bike makes her rather conspicuous to potential art recipients sitting atop her high " mutant bicycle , " aisha ronniger , who is in charge of the project , explained that it all started as a joke among design students four years ago .
meanwhile , it has turned the street art scene around the world upside down .
ronniger found a way of getting around bans on hanging up posters in public areas .
" you just have to throw the artworks right in front of people 's noses , " she said .
the project has grown each year since its inception , becoming more international and multimedial .
nearly 240 artists from 18 different countries have sent their works - both originals and copies - to ronniger to be considered for the project .
bloggers , filmmakers and photographers have also helped to promote the idea around the world and make it more international .
berlin 's " paper girls " now have sisters in new york , cape town , bucharest and manchester .
analog and anachronistic ronniger 's art project takes an anachronistic approach that stresses both the art of giving and technical expertise , which she believes is disappearing more and more in our digitized world .
" the internet prevents a feel for the dimensions of a work of art , and for its haptics , as well as for the value of the artwork itself , " she said .
bildunterschrift : a surprise is always waiting inside some of the project 's artworks take true and false friends - and everyday life as it occurs on the internet - as their subjects .
artist sp38 's posters scream " i do n't wanna be u 're friend on facebook . "
claudia berhardt 's work shows a woman with a suitcase , who has remembered to pack everything , but does n't know her destination .
" which way ? " reads the speech bubble .
chance decides , at any rate , which direction the project 's art will go .
after a two-hour tour around the city distributing the works at random , " the only thing left over is adrenaline , " said ronniger , stopping at a street light .
street art as luxury item andreea gazdaru and bianca mihai want some of that light-heartedness to come to their home town of bucharest when they start the first paper girl festival there in september .
" street art is a luxury in romania , " said gazdaru , who has a scholarship to participate in the berlin project , just like some of her other international colleagues .
" many of the people i know would like to submit their works , but can not even afford the costs of printing , " the 25-year-old regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all rolled up and ready to go nevertheless , she 's certain the project will stirs things up in bucharest .
" everything still has its place in romania , " she said .
" people believe art belongs in museums , and cars on the street . "
marcii goose has tried to launch the paper girls project in cape town , but has n't had an easy time of it .
when she tosses things to people on the street , they panic , the south african said .
" they usually think a rock is being thrown at them , " she said .
for paper girls ' third run in cape town 's woodstock neighborhood , where many poor people , as well as artists , live , rather than throwing the artworks through the air , she took the time to place them in people 's hands and talk with the lucky recipients .
" we do n't want to provoke people ; we just want to make them happy , " she said .
the 32-year-old had read about the paper girls project on the internet and decided it was time for a change in her life .
" as a creative director for 10 years , i put art at the mercy of commerce - and at some point , i no longer recognized myself , " she recalled .
" that 's changed now . "
just around the corner the future for paper girls in berlin , at any rate , is uncertain .
aisha ronniger has just finished her training as a graphic designer and is ready to pass over the reins .
there are n't many around who want to fill her shoes , though .
bildunterschrift : armagan isbay is thrilled with the artworks pizza maker armagan isbay may be one of the last to receive art from the paper girls .
" god has heard my prayers , " he quipped , " i had just thought , ' how great it would be if a little more life came into this downbeat corner of the neighborhood . '
and then , i got this tossed into my lap ! "

the festival-goers were crushed in a tunnel on their way to festival grounds , according to police . at least 19 people died after a stampede broke out at the love parade techno music festival in the western german city of duisburg on saturday .
authorities in duisburg scheduled a press conference for sunday to detail the cause of the mass panic . the tragedy occurred in a tunnel on the way to the festival grounds as police were trying to prevent people from entering the overcrowded site .
thousands of fans had been walking along a hundred-meter pathway toward the festival for several hours . in interviews with german media , eyewitnesses questioned the safety of the 200-meter -lrb- 650-foot -rrb- long and 30-meter wide tunnel that served as the love parade 's main access . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tunnel served as the main entrance to the love parade there was also some concern ahead of the festival that duisburg 's former railway freight yard would not be able to accommodate all the party-goers .
in an interview with der westen , organizers said the venue could hold up to 500,000 people .
some 1.4 million people were estimated to have attended the event , about 200,000 less than the previous year 's love parade in dortmund . duisburg police commissioner juergen kieskemper described the situation as " very chaotic , " and said they were still trying to determine exactly what happened . city authorities earlier confirmed that 15 people had died and said an additional 80 were injured in the tunnel .
facing the crush of the crowd , paramedics had difficulty getting through to the site .
police later said that 16 people had died at the scene and that a further three had died of their injuries . early on sunday , police drastically increased the number of people reported injured to 342 . ' no turning back ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site festival-goers described a mass of people pushing with unstoppable force . it took sergei benkogenov and vitaly dippel from hamm three hours to reach the festival grounds from duisburg 's train station .
at some point , they wondered if their efforts were worth it . " we really would have liked to turn around and go home , but it was impossible , " said 19-year-old benkogenov .
" there was no turning back . " " no one knew where the love parade started , " bekogenov added .
" the line was endless . " right before reports of the stampede , with thousands in line waiting to get in , police announced at 5:34 p.m. that the festival grounds had reached capacity and were being closed . " the police announced by loudspeaker that participants should return in the direction of the train station , " said one eyewitness . authorities , however , later said at a press conference saturday at the duisburg city hall that the festival grounds were not yet filled at the time of the tragedy . merkel , wulff express condolences german chancellor angela merkel offered her sympathy to the victims ' families , saying she was horrified by the day 's events . " the young people came to celebrate , instead there were deaths and injuries , " she said .
" i am appalled and distressed at the suffering and pain . " german president christian wulff also expressed his condolences saturday evening in berlin for the victims of the tragedy that had " caused death , sorrow and pain amidst a peaceful festival of cheerful young people from many countries . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party went on " for security reasons " " my thoughts are with the victims of the tragedy and with all their family and friends , " wulff said , adding that he hoped for a full explanation as to the causes of the incident . the mayor of duisburg , adolf sauerland , said that safety arrangements put in place by the city and festival organizers had been substantial .
he also said an investigation to determine the precise cause of the tragedy had been started . " in the run-up to the event , we worked out a solid security plan with the organizers and everyone involved , " he said .
" my thoughts are with the victims and their relatives .
the love parade is supposed to be a peaceful and joyful celebration . " north rhine-westphalia state premier hannelore kraft expressed her own shock and said that investigators would need time to establish what had happened . party goes on spokesman frank kopatschek told news agency dpa on saturday evening that " the city of duisburg 's action committee has decided not to end the festival for now , for safety reasons . " kopatschek said the city was concerned about preventing further panic among the 1.4 million people in attendance . organizers ended their live streaming of the event , replacing it with a message that offered " sincere condolences " to relatives . police have activated a hotline for family members of festival-goers anxious about the well-being of their loved ones . the love parade festival began in berlin in 1989 but moved to the ruhr region in 2007 .

" street art is a luxury in romania , " said gazdaru , who has a scholarship to participate in the berlin project , just like some of her other international colleagues .
" many of the people i know would like to submit their works , but can not even afford the costs of printing , " the 25-year-old regretted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all rolled up and ready to go nevertheless , she 's certain the project will stirs things up in bucharest .
" everything still has its place in romania , " she said .
" people believe art belongs in museums , and cars on the street . "
marcii goose has tried to launch the paper girls project in cape town , but has n't had an easy time of it .
when she tosses things to people on the street , they panic , the south african said .
" they usually think a rock is being thrown at them , " she said .
for paper girls ' third run in cape town 's woodstock neighborhood , where many poor people , as well as artists , live , rather than throwing the artworks through the air , she took the time to place them in people 's hands and talk with the lucky recipients .
" we do n't want to provoke people ; we just want to make them happy , " she said .
the 32-year-old had read about the paper girls project on the internet and decided it was time for a change in her life .
" as a creative director for 10 years , i put art at the mercy of commerce - and at some point , i no longer recognized myself , " she recalled .
" that 's changed now . "
just around the corner the future for paper girls in berlin , at any rate , is uncertain .
aisha ronniger has just finished her training as a graphic designer and is ready to pass over the reins .
there are n't many around who want to fill her shoes , though .
bildunterschrift : armagan isbay is thrilled with the artworks pizza maker armagan isbay may be one of the last to receive art from the paper girls .
" god has heard my prayers , " he quipped , " i had just thought , ' how great it would be if a little more life came into this downbeat corner of the neighborhood . '
and then , i got this tossed into my lap ! "

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

the festival-goers were crushed in a tunnel on their way to festival grounds , according to police . at least 19 people died after a stampede broke out at the love parade techno music festival in the western german city of duisburg on saturday .
authorities in duisburg scheduled a press conference for sunday to detail the cause of the mass panic . the tragedy occurred in a tunnel on the way to the festival grounds as police were trying to prevent people from entering the overcrowded site .
thousands of fans had been walking along a hundred-meter pathway toward the festival for several hours . in interviews with german media , eyewitnesses questioned the safety of the 200-meter -lrb- 650-foot -rrb- long and 30-meter wide tunnel that served as the love parade 's main access . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tunnel served as the main entrance to the love parade there was also some concern ahead of the festival that duisburg 's former railway freight yard would not be able to accommodate all the party-goers .
in an interview with der westen , organizers said the venue could hold up to 500,000 people .
some 1.4 million people were estimated to have attended the event , about 200,000 less than the previous year 's love parade in dortmund . duisburg police commissioner juergen kieskemper described the situation as " very chaotic , " and said they were still trying to determine exactly what happened . city authorities earlier confirmed that 15 people had died and said an additional 80 were injured in the tunnel .
facing the crush of the crowd , paramedics had difficulty getting through to the site .
police later said that 16 people had died at the scene and that a further three had died of their injuries . early on sunday , police drastically increased the number of people reported injured to 342 . ' no turning back ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site festival-goers described a mass of people pushing with unstoppable force . it took sergei benkogenov and vitaly dippel from hamm three hours to reach the festival grounds from duisburg 's train station .
at some point , they wondered if their efforts were worth it . " we really would have liked to turn around and go home , but it was impossible , " said 19-year-old benkogenov .
" there was no turning back . " " no one knew where the love parade started , " bekogenov added .
" the line was endless . " right before reports of the stampede , with thousands in line waiting to get in , police announced at 5:34 p.m. that the festival grounds had reached capacity and were being closed . " the police announced by loudspeaker that participants should return in the direction of the train station , " said one eyewitness . authorities , however , later said at a press conference saturday at the duisburg city hall that the festival grounds were not yet filled at the time of the tragedy . merkel , wulff express condolences german chancellor angela merkel offered her sympathy to the victims ' families , saying she was horrified by the day 's events . " the young people came to celebrate , instead there were deaths and injuries , " she said .
" i am appalled and distressed at the suffering and pain . " german president christian wulff also expressed his condolences saturday evening in berlin for the victims of the tragedy that had " caused death , sorrow and pain amidst a peaceful festival of cheerful young people from many countries . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party went on " for security reasons " " my thoughts are with the victims of the tragedy and with all their family and friends , " wulff said , adding that he hoped for a full explanation as to the causes of the incident . the mayor of duisburg , adolf sauerland , said that safety arrangements put in place by the city and festival organizers had been substantial .
he also said an investigation to determine the precise cause of the tragedy had been started . " in the run-up to the event , we worked out a solid security plan with the organizers and everyone involved , " he said .
" my thoughts are with the victims and their relatives .
the love parade is supposed to be a peaceful and joyful celebration . " north rhine-westphalia state premier hannelore kraft expressed her own shock and said that investigators would need time to establish what had happened . party goes on spokesman frank kopatschek told news agency dpa on saturday evening that " the city of duisburg 's action committee has decided not to end the festival for now , for safety reasons . " kopatschek said the city was concerned about preventing further panic among the 1.4 million people in attendance . organizers ended their live streaming of the event , replacing it with a message that offered " sincere condolences " to relatives . police have activated a hotline for family members of festival-goers anxious about the well-being of their loved ones . the love parade festival began in berlin in 1989 but moved to the ruhr region in 2007 .
it also led to numerous other events around the world being held under the " love parade " banner . author : david levitz , richard connor -lrb- afp / ap / apn / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crowd was overwhelmed in the tunnel cause of the tragedy the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has been accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out .

but questions remain as to what caused the tragedy . as the investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy .
duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the tragedy remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials had few answers to offer about the causes of the tragedy von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede .
" i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .

a memorable three-week duel between contador and saxo bank team rider andy schleck took center stage on an eventful tour .

the defining stages in the battle for yellow were always going to be thursday 's climb of the fierce col du tourmalet and the individual time trial on saturday , though .
contador had enough on both occasions .
he stuck to schleck 's wheel on thursday , and extended his lead by half a minute two days later .
after three weeks and close to 92 hours in the saddle , schleck finished just 39 seconds behind his rival .
armstrong makes his exit russian denis menchov rounded off the overall podium two minutes behind contador .
frenchman anthony charteau confirmed himself in the polka-dot jersey for the best rider in the mountains when the tour left the pyrenees on thursday .
italy 's alessandro petacchi crossed the line second in paris to claim the green jersey for picking up the most sprint points .
the tour 's most successful ever rider , seven-time winner lance armstrong , completed the race for the final time .
the 38-year-old american retired for the first time in 2005 , before returning to come third in 2009 .
after finishing 24th this year , he says he is out of the saddle for good .
the 2010 tour began three weeks ago in the dutch city of rotterdam , and spent three days in the netherlands and belgium before reaching france .
french riders enjoyed a hugely successful year , winning six of the race 's 20 stages .
